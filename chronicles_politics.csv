Under the visionary leadership of President Mnangagwa, this ambitious project holds the promise of transforming the country into a vibrant and attractive destination for tourists and foreign investors alike. The cyber city, bankrolled by Mulk International, will make Zimbabwe the first African country with a “smart” capital city built from scratch. Just outside the present-day capital, New Harare or Zim Cyber City in Mount Hampden, is slated to become a state-of-the-art artificially intelligent city with interconnected government buildings, smooth traffic, round-the-clock security, prime real estate, and top-notch malls.  President Mnangagwa’s support and approval of the US$500 million Zim Cyber City project showcases his dedication to spearheading transformative projects in the country. The ambitious endeavour has the potential to become his crowning glory among the various development initiatives undertaken during his tenure. By aligning Zimbabwe with a multinational conglomerate like Mulk International, the President has shown a keen understanding of the power of strategic partnerships. The collaboration brings together the expertise, resources, and global recognition of Mulk International with the President’s vision for a prosperous and modern Zimbabwe.  One of the key benefits of Zim Cyber City is its potential to boost tourism in the country. With its state-of-the-art infrastructure and world-class amenities, the city will attract visitors from all over the globe.  The inclusion of a duty-free mall and high-end residential living will create a sophisticated and luxurious environment, catering to the discerning tastes of tourists seeking an elevated experience. The availability of pre-approved mortgages from banks in US dollars is a groundbreaking move that will facilitate investment and attract a diverse range of tourists and investors. “We have been trying to bring the Dubai standard of living to this particular development. The project will have high-end villas, we call them Zim Hills, surrounding water bodies. We will have a very tall tower with the shopping centre,” said Shaji ul Mulk, the Mulk International chairman last year.  Moreover, Zim Cyber City’s integration into the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) programme highlights the Government’s commitment to promoting sustainable growth and attracting investments. The SEZ status ensures fast-track clearances for foreign direct investments, making it easier for businesses to establish themselves in  Zimbabwe. This streamlined process will undoubtedly encourage both local and international companies to invest in the country, fostering economic growth and job creation. Infrastructure development is another crucial aspect of Zim Cyber City’s impact on Zimbabwe’s progress. The project encompasses a vast area and includes the construction of high-end residential and commercial buildings, complemented by the newly completed Parliament building and ministry buildings. This comprehensive development plan demonstrates a commitment to modernising and revitalising Zimbabwe’s infrastructure, providing a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. “The investment by the UAE (United Arab Emirates) investor in the Smart City Project is quite instrumental from the economic development point of view. “So of course we expect businesses to benefit, local businesses to benefit out of that employment creation and the development of basic infrastructure. We are seeing a huge infrastructure gap in Zimbabwe and we think that those kinds of investments would actually catapult us in reaching our Vision 2030 objectives to be a middle-income nation,” said Batanai Matsika, the head of research, Morgan & Co.  In addition to its economic benefits, Zim Cyber City aims to enhance the beauty and attractiveness of Zimbabwe. The modern architectural designs, high-tech surveillance systems, and meticulously planned community spaces will create a visually stunning  and secure environment. As the city flourishes, it will serve as a testament to Zimbabwe’s potential and allure, enticing foreign investors and tourists to explore the country’s many offerings.  The project’s emphasis on sustainability and technological innovation is another aspect that sets Zim Cyber City apart. The incorporation of advanced surveillance technology directly connected to law enforcement authorities ensures the safety and security of residents and visitors. Additionally, the city’s commitment to green building practices and renewable energy sources will contribute to environmental conservation and position Zimbabwe as a leader in sustainable development. Zim Cyber City’s success will not be limited to its immediate surroundings. Its impact will extend beyond the city’s borders, leading to the improvement of infrastructure and services in other parts of Zimbabwe. The Government, recognising the potential of the project, will likely allocate resources to upgrade transportation networks, communication systems, and utilities to support the growth of Zim Cyber City and accommodate the increased demand from tourists and businesses. The project’s partnership with Mulk International also brings a wealth of expertise, experience, and global connections to Zimbabwe. The collaboration will foster knowledge transfer, skill development, and technology exchange, which will benefit local industries and contribute to the country’s long-term economic growth. “The development of Zim Cyber City will have a ripple effect on the overall economy of the country. As the city thrives, it will create numerous job opportunities across various sectors, including construction, hospitality, retail, and services. The influx of new businesses and investments will spur economic growth and contribute to the overall prosperity of the country,” Marshall Ndlela, an economic analyst says. Moreover, the success of Zim Cyber City will create a positive image for Zimbabwe on the global stage. The city’s modern infrastructure, high-quality amenities, and commitment to sustainable development will showcase Zimbabwe’s potential and attractiveness as an investment destination. This positive perception will not only draw in foreign investors but also boost the country’s tourism industry, attracting visitors who will explore other attractions and contribute to local businesses across Zimbabwe.  Without a doubt, President Mnangagwa’s support for Zim Cyber City reflects his Government’s commitment to driving economic development and attracting foreign investments. By spearheading this transformative project, he demonstrates his leadership and vision for a prosperous Zimbabwe. The successful completion and operation of Zim Cyber City will stand as a testament to his administration’s efforts in promoting economic growth, job creation, and the overall improvement of the country’s living standards. A lot can be said about Zim Cyber City, in short, it holds immense potential for economic and social development for Zimbabwe. With its focus on tourism, infrastructure development, and strategic partnerships, the city is poised to become a catalyst for growth, attracting foreign investments, creating jobs, and enhancing the country’s overall image. Under President Mnangagwa’s leadership, this ambitious project may indeed become his crowning glory, solidifying his Government’s legacy in driving sustainable national development and prosperity. — @plainstan "

THE Government has moved a gear up in operationalising the principles of devolution to push economic and sustainable development from community to national level to realise Vision 2030. The vision, as enunciated by President Mnangagwa, is to turn the country into an upper-middle-class economy by that year. This was said by the minister responsible for Monitoring and Evaluation in the Office of the President, Dr Joram Gumbo while touring an amacimbi/madora processing plant in the Matshiloni area of Beitbridge. He said devolution demanded that provincial authorities be empowered to spearhead economic and social development in their jurisdictions by leveraging local resources. “In this regard, my office will work closely with the provinces to ensure that provincial flagship projects are successfully implemented through the Rapid Results Initiative. The Government has also adopted the 100-day target-based program to expedite project implementation and to address anomalies associated with project implementation,” said Dr Gumbo. He said the revival of the country’s economic fortunes needed everyone’s support including those in the Government and the private sector. Dr Gumbo said in the past most Government projects’ implementation was hindered by various sector performance deficiencies hence the need for a phased work programme. “The adoption of the 100-day target-based programme symbolises the Government’s commitment to expeditiously implement projects for the benefit of citizens. My previous visits to different projects under the programme bear testimony that Rapid Results Approach is yielding positive results and is contributing to the improvement of the livelihoods of our people,” said the Minister. He said the Government was intent on ensuring that the 100-day target-based programme will lead to the realisation of development goals set out in the Transitional Stabilisation Programme which will be succeeded today by the National Development Strategy 1. Dr Gumbo commended the Rovhona Raita Co-operative in Beitbridge which initiated the setting up of the amacimbi and multi-purpose processing plant. He said the project fitted well into the devolution concept which promotes the economic growth of local economies driven by resources within different communities. “Zimbabwe has the potential to earn significant revenue from the export of mopane worms (amacimbi) to Europe, Japan, and other countries in the region where they are highly sought after.
“These (amacimbi) are rich in various nutrients, according to food experts and these are areas therefore where we have a comparative advantage but we are not making use of it,” said the Minister. He said it was very critical for the Government to avail resources to construct the requisite infrastructure to promote the growth of small to medium enterprises nationwide. Dr Gumbo said the processing of amacimbi and other horticulture produce was in line with the thrust of the Government to promote value addition and beneficiation. He said the plant will not only boost employment but will also reduce post-harvest losses, transportation costs, provide proper grading infrastructure and address the problem of depressed prices, especially among small-scale traders. “The plant will also play a critical role in addressing hygiene issues associated with the processing of amacimbi and thereby empowering local traders to be competitive. “At the same time, we are concerned with the case of deforestation where some people cut down trees to harvest amacimbi. This is unacceptable, we need to review the harvesting methodologies and also create mopane tree nurseries to replenish the natural resources,” said Dr Gumbo. — @tupeyo "

THE rate with which Government is moving in implementing works at the Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme in Binga District, reflects the serious approach to development and commitment towards creating employment and alleviating poverty through transforming the area into an economic hub. The irrigation scheme will transform the district, previously viewed as lagging behind in terms of development despite its vast potential. It is envisaged that the irrigation scheme, which is currently being expanded to cover 15 000 hectares, will promote food and nutrition security in the country, which is reeling under the effects of climate change and recurrent drought. The Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (Arda) has since entered into a joint venture with a local private company to put 15 000 hectares of land under food and export crops as well as crocodile farming. The New Dispensation led by President Mnangagwa has released funds for the completion of the projects at Bulawayo Kraal with a lot of work currently underway. Bulawayo Kraal pump house engines Already 467 pipes for the mainline linking the engine water pumps from the Zambezi River to the overnight storage dams have been delivered with three centre pivots having been rehabilitated at the scheme. Another overnight storage dam and pump engine houses are almost complete. An engine pump with a capacity to pump 315 cubic metres of water per hour has been installed in the Zambezi River. At least 200 hectares of land has been cleared for the summer cropping season. Government has since engaged an on-site engineering consultant Mr Paul Kruger to offer technical assistance. Under the Second Republic, Government is prioritising the revival of the agricultural sector through the development of irrigation schemes to alleviate food insecurity and poverty particularly in rural communities. Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga’s countless visits to the irrigation scheme to assess progress, reflects the New Dispensation’s commitment to fulfilling the devolution agenda. Speaking during his tour to assess progress on the implementation of ongoing works at Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme on Sunday, V P Chiwenga said Government will not tire in ensuring that there is enough food in the country as evidenced by the recently launched Agriculture and Food Systems Transformation Strategy. President Mnangagwa launched the programme whose aim is to provide a compass for agriculture in line with Vision 2030. Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme pipes VP Chiwenga said the Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme remains one of the Government’s key priorities. The Minister of State for Matabeleland North Richard Moyo said the rehabilitation of Bulawayo Kraal highlights Government’s commitment in ensuring that communities living in areas surrounded by water bodies benefit from their natural resources. “The revival of Bulawayo Kraal signifies the commitment by Government under the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa to transform lives of rural communities. This massive project, which has for a long time been lying idle has got a new lease of life and people in Binga and surrounding areas will certainly reap rewards from the vast water in the Zambezi River,” he said. “This project marks a new dawn for people in the district and surrounding areas as it represents a significant turnaround and economic transformation, not only for Binga, but the entire province.” Established in 1996 after local villagers from Manjolo and Siachilaba approached Government for assistance in terms of developing an irrigation scheme to cushion them from the adverse effects of drought, Bulawayo Kraal faced a series of challenges in terms of funding. However, with the coming of the New Dispensation, the face of Bulawayo Kraal has changed. The revitalisation of Bulawayo Kraal is in line with President Mnangagwa’s thrust to ensure the realisation of Matabeleland North’s full economic potential in line with the devolution policy. Chief Sikalenge, in whose jurisdiction Bulawayo Kraal falls under, said the ongoing expansion works at the irrigation scheme were a positive development for the district. “We have Zambezi River but for a long time we failed to utilise the water from that water body. What we are witnessing at Bulawayo Kraal is a positive development and a reflection of our Government’s commitment to addressing poverty and hunger and it will transform lives in Binga,” he said. The resuscitation of the country’s agricultural sector remains vital to improving the livelihoods of ordinary Zimbabweans and irrigation development could be the answer as climate change has affected rainfall patterns. However, only three percent of the country’s agricultural activity is under irrigation and this has had a negative impact on output, highlighting the urgent need to put more effort in irrigation development. The resuscitation of Bulawayo Kraal has also brought smiles to the locals. Mrs Florence Munsaka of Manjolo said they were hoping to reap economic benefits once the irrigation scheme is fully operational as they venture into sustainable projects. “As locals, we have pinned our hopes on the rehabilitation of Bulawayo Kraal and once it is up and running everyone will benefit and there will be employment for us so that we take care of their families, especially at such a time when we are facing starvation due to drought,” she said. Another villager, Mr Peter Muleya said the irrigation scheme has been lying idle for a very long time despite the abundance of water in the Zambezi River. “We are quite grateful to the Government for this gesture and it is our hope that through this project everyone will benefit. We are particularly looking at farming and if we can get small plots and there will also be a lot of employment opportunities for our children since there is an investor who has been roped in by Government to develop the project,” he said. “The irrigation scheme will boost food security and ensure that we move from subsistence towards prosperity as there will be a lot of commercial farming activities.” Already Government, under the Agriculture Recovery Plan, has set aside 100 000 hectares of land, which will be transformed into a greenbelt with an anticipated yield of at least 1 million tonnes of maize within the next three years. The massive project — to be implemented at Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme in Binga, Matabeleland North, in the lowveld areas of Masvingo and Kanyemba in Mashonaland Central — will be done in phases and will boost food production and alleviate food shortages in the country largely attributed to recurrent drought. Government is roping in the private sector in the programme. Under the programme, 100  000 hectares of virgin land will be opened up in the three identified provinces. The programme will also help in cutting imports and accelerate the attainment of Vision 2030 goals. — @mashnets "

TWO telecommunications giants NetOne and TelOne have refurbished a 35-bed ward at Mpilo Central Hospital as part of the $10 million project to help the Government fight Covid-19 at public institutions. The $10 million was set aside last April by the two companies to refurbish Mpilo, Beatrice Infectious Disease Hospital and Sally Mugabe Hospital. The ward B5 investment is said to be the biggest ever at Mpilo and will enable members of the public to access state-of-the-art monitors which will enable medical personnel to detect patients’ blood pressure, temperature and pulse from the same machine which is quicker than the traditional method of using different types of equipment. Part of the refurbishment also include new bedding and linen. Now with grey and white walls and new curtains, B5 which is mainly for men, will be reserved for Covid-19 patients if the need arises. The two companies also replaced all sinks, taps, bath tubs and tiled the floors. Deputy Minister of Information Communication Technology (ICT), Postal and Courier Services Dingu-muzi Phuti (second from left) officially opens Ward B5 at Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo yesterday. The Minister of State for Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Cde Judith Ncube (left), Deputy Minister of Health and Child Care Dr John Mangwiro (right), NetOne, TelOne officials and hospital staff clap hands in jubilation The ward also has colourful nurse stations, bed numbers and room labels made from stickers with TelOne and NetOne logos. B5 ward is now decorated with huge frames with NetOne and TelOne colours which include black, orange, blue and white. Before the refurbishment, the ward which is part of the 10 other wards within the main hospital built in 1958, had cracked floors, old bath tubs, sinks and taps which were difficult to repair due to resource challenges. Speaking at the handover ceremony of the fully equipped and refurbished Ward B5 yesterday, ICT, Postal and Courier Services Minister Jenfan Muswere said it was imperative for corporates to assist the Government by mobilising resources towards mitigation and containment in times of crisis. He said the ministry and companies under its purview had accelerated digital innovations that seek to promote telecommuting or remote working. In a speech read on his behalf by his Deputy Cde Dingumuzi Phuti, Minister Muswere said he was committed to increasing support towards the fight against Covid-19 and other healthcare challenges. “This commitment was pledged to his Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, at State House in April this year,” said Minister Muswere. “A fortnight ago we were at Sally Mugabe Hospital witnessing the fantastic work by NetOne and TelOne, and today I am excited to be unveiling a newly refurbished 35-bed Ward B5 here at Mpilo Hospital.” Our economic recovery as a nation, he added, will be leveraged on rebuilding through smart technologies premised on ICTs. Deputy Minister Phuti (picture right) is having his blood pressure taken as other officials curiously look on The two companies are working on drilling six boreholes for Mpilo, Sally Mugabe Hospital and Beatrice Infectious Diseases Hospital set to reduce the number of people contracting Covid-19. Speaking during the same handover, deputy Minister of Health and Child Care Dr John Mangwiro called on other corporates to chip in and help the Government improve public health institutions. “Today as we accept the refurbished Ward B5, the new furniture and equipment together with the drilled borehole and water tanks provided, I would also want to acknowledge the Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) which was donated earlier in May. I am aware all this is part of your Covid-19 response package which you announced through a symbolic ZWL$10-million cheque handover to His Excellency, President Mnangagwa,” he said. According to Dr Mangwiro, Covid-19 impact in terms of serious illnesses and morbidity had been relatively low but preparations to respond and manage the pandemic had not been easy for the country. “While they announced the intervention to be pegged at ZWL$10 million, I know the amount has already almost doubled due to inflation with costs for Mpilo Hospital projects alone at ZWL$5,2 million. Indeed, the sincerity of both companies to see the fullness of this project is evident as you continued with your works despite the increase in the budget.” Dr Mangwiro said the refurbished ward will also come in handy in the fight against Covid-19 which has claimed 225 lives so far and other prevalent diseases in Zimbabwe. “While faced with this, we also have other diseases like cancer, malaria, HIV-Aids which remain alive and need management by the same hospitals. Maternal and paediatric health are also areas that remain key on our health radar. It is therefore delighting to note the ward refurbishment and borehole drilling initiatives will live beyond the challenges of the moment,” he said. NetOne chief executive officer Ms Chipo Jaisson said it was the company’s mission to transform lives and develop communities by providing support towards improving the health and well being of Zimbabweans. “We understand that the current state of our public health care sector impacts on the ability and level of preparedness to deal with Covid-19. We are confident that the newly refurbished and modernised ward being unveiled today will make our public health facilities more appealing and allow them to accommodate more patients in a clean and ecstatic environment as well as provide affordable health care to the general populace that may not be able to access private health care,” said Ms Jaisson. She said NetOne’s One-health initiative is linked to the sustainable development goal (SDG) plan which seeks to ensure healthy lives by providing water and sanitation for all. TelOne managing director Mrs Chipo Mtasa said the partnership with NetOne has seen the telecommunication companies bring joy to many vulnerable communities in Zimbabwe. “We also have the Covid-19 rural health facilities programme running which has reached rural clinics in 13 districts with Covid-19 response packages including PPEs for frontline staff and other materials. Just last week we were in Matopo and Ndolwane where such donations were made,” said Mrs Mtasa. “I call on other corporates to consider partnering the Ministry of Health and Child Care so that we can all play our part in transforming the country’s health sector.” "

THE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) will soon issue a directive to facilitate smooth repatriation of capital and dividends by foreign investors, which will buttress the ease of doing business in the country. Treasury is pushing the matter in response to investor concerns over the country’s exchange and capital controls, which are perceived to be a stumbling block to attracting foreign direct investment. Finance and Economic Development Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube told a recent virtual market analyst briefing on the establishment of the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) that the challenge of repatriating funds was being addressed following lengthy discussions with the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) executives and the RBZ. He said the framework, to be soon tabled by the Central Bank, will also give impetus to the successful operationalisation of an offshore capital market in the form of VFEX, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the ZSE. The minister was responding to sub-Saharan Africa economist at Renaissance Capital, Yvonne Mhango, who said the difficulty in repatriating funds was a big investor concern that Zimbabwe needs to urgently resolve. “It makes sense initially to make our central bank, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, involved more directly in the settlement process. That is being fine-tuned and that will be the case, the reason being to deal directly with what Yvonne raised,” said Prof Ncube. “We want guarantees that there will be full conversion and there is commitment from the Government and RBZ that the foreign currency will be made available. “That’s why we want RBZ to be involved initially (at VFEX) but over time other banks with strong balance sheets and skills would also be involved.” Given that VFEX will be denominated in the United States dollar, investors are keen to get guarantees on the ease to repatriate their dividends unlike what is happening on ZSE now, said Mhango. ZSE chief executive officer, Mr Justin Bgoni, who also attended the webinar, concurred with Prof Ncube. “This is one of the areas where we have put in a lot of work on, especially with the Central Bank. Shortly the central bank will be issuing out a directive that will address a lot of these concerns including how investment can be done on the exchange,” he said. “A lot of that will be very clear, it would be easy for foreign investors to come in and go out. Without disclosing much because we are finalising the discussion with the reserve bank, what I can promise is that the Reserve bank has been very forthcoming, they understand this concern and the directive that will come will be very clear. “I can promise it will be easy for investors to come in and easy for them to repatriate funds.” VFEX was recently issued with a licence and would be denominated in foreign currency. It targets foreign investors as well as global capital markets especially the mining industry. Government is already engaged in ongoing discussions with several international investment financiers to support VFEX that will trade exclusively in foreign currency. "

PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday officially launched the National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy as he led the re-start of the sector, whose contribution to the national economy has been heavily crippled by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The President also officially re-opened the Victoria Falls Rainforest, signalling readiness for the country to welcome visitors into the prime resort destination. The tourism and hospitality industry is one of the key foreign currency earners in the country and employs thousands of people along the value chain. The President also opened Mbano Manor Hotel Despite the Covid-19 dent on arrivals, Zimbabwe expects to leverage on internal competencies around domestic tourism to unlock wider potential and enhancing operators’ capacities on the interim. In this regard, the National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy will seek to provide increased funding to affected tourism businesses, including small to medium players within the tourism value chain through a Tourism Revolving Fund. Officially launching the strategy document here, President Mnangagwa said the tourism sector has an important role to play in the attainment of the National Vision as one of the four pillars underpinning economic growth alongside agriculture, mining and manufacturing. “The National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy we are launching today, is anchored on Zimbabwe’s vision to be a prime international tourist destination based in the judicious and sustainable exploitation of the unique assets of nature, culture, heritage and the built environment. Dr Matifadza Nyazema shows off one of the bathrooms at her hotel “The strategy is informed by the Government’s Vision 2030 to become an upper middle income economy characterised by increased investment, decent jobs and populace free from poverty and corruption,” said the President. “The high growth target of this strategy, which seeks to achieve a US$5 billion tourism economy by year 2025 is ambitious and yet achievable. “This strategy will also facilitate robust investment into the tourism sector to create employment and help support livelihoods.” As such, President Mnangagwa challenged players in the sector to work harder to achieve increased domestic and international tourist arrivals, room occupancy and higher tourist expenditures. He said the new strategy focus requires industry players to be creative and innovative by offering the target markets new products and services that continuously give the country a competitive edge in the region and globally. Already Government has availed a $500 million guarantee facility for access by the sector to support Covid-19 affected entities to stay afloat and save jobs. The initiative is part of the $18 billion Stimulus Package recently unveiled by Treasury in response to the pandemic. The tourism sector also enjoys value added tax exemption for a year on products offered locally as part of cushioning measures for the sector. In view of increased Government support to the industry, President Mnangagwa called on the tourism sector to “re-examine its pricing models” in order to complement the need for tourists to enjoy benefits of products on offer. He also encouraged locals to explore and enjoy the vast tourism destinations and products throughout the country.  Earlier, President Mnangagwa led a ministerial delegation on a tour of the Victoria Falls Rainforest before officially re-opening it. He was accompanied by Cabinet ministers Professor Mthuli Ncube (Finance and Economic Development), Dr Sithembiso Nyoni (Women Affairs and SMEs), July Moyo (Local Government), Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri (Defence), Owen Ncube (State Security), Mangaliso Ndlovu (Tourism), Matabeleland North Provincial Minister Richard Moyo, Deputy Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet George Charamba and several senior Government officials. The world heritage site, through which tourists get to view the mighty Victoria Falls, was closed for 100 days following the outbreak of Covid-19 as part of national mitigation efforts against the spread of the pandemic. President Mnangagwa said while the lockdown period has crippled arrivals, it has led to the reinvigoration of the falls themselves and the renewal of the ecosystem and the surrounding enviroment. During the tour the Presidential delegation and business players observed with more joy that the water level at the falls had risen to breaking level, an indication of how Zimbabwe remains attractive and enjoyable to the local and global visitor. President Mnangagwa, however, stressed the need for the country to remain vigilant while opening up the tourism sector by strictly adhering to health and safety guidelines stipulated by the World Health Organisation to curb Covid-19 infections. Earlier in his address, Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu, said the launch of the new tourism recovery strategy was historic. Coming on the back of a projected tourism drop in arrivals and loss of billions in potential revenue globally, there was a need to come up with urgent measures to counter the impact hence the strategy launch. As it stands now, like all other sectors of the economy, tourism has to look inward for survival. In the absence of regional and international tourist arrivals, the industry has to place its focus on domestic tourism in order to preserve jobs and livelihoods,” said Minister Ndlovu. He said the strategy document details the implementation matrix towards growth and recovery, which is set to be tested by results. “We will not be deterred by the virus. We, therefore, remain hopeful that the tourism industry will rise again and our vision of a US$5 billion tourism economy will be attained,” said the minister. "

ZIMBABWEAN women should gain inspiration from aggressive entrepreneurs like Dr Matifadza Nyazema who has fought hard to establish one of the country’s top locally-owned hospitality facilities in the resort town of Victoria Falls. The official opening of the Mbano Manor Hotel here yesterday by President Mnangagwa was historic and iconic, as the unique luxury boutique hotel was conceptualised and developed by a black female Zimbabwean. The launch of the US$8 million facility was part of the critical programme by the President in launching the National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy. The new hotel is an all-suite premium luxury property that was completed early this year and comprises of 19 suites, including a masterpiece forest villa. The uniqueness of the investment lies in the sustainable co-existence of the hotel with nature. The hotel is located within the ancient teak forest of the Zambezi National Park and only two trees were taken down in its development, ensuring that the natural forest remains intact. Its exterior design embraces the effortless countryside yet modern taste defined by large bungalow architecture, open flowing public areas and imposing verandas. “This indeed is the most magnificent place I have ever been. Most importantly we are both in the bush as well as in the first world,” said President Mnangagwa amid applause from the gathering, as he officially opened the business after leading a ministerial delegation on a tour of the unique facility. “Women of Zimbabwe have raised the bar above. It is pleasing that this mammoth investment was put together by a local company, Matizimunda Investments. “I commend the admirable high standard of workmanship and products that are on show on this facility. This will undoubtedly help attract the target market and clientele for the hotel.” The President described the facility as “elegant” saying it was gratifying that Dr Nyazema in her design sought to maximise investment that is socially and enviromentally friendly. But who is Dr Nyazema and what inspires her? She is an award winning and tourism and hotel professional, with over 30 years of hospitality experience including involvement in global travel companies and hotel start-ups across several countries. “I have travelled to over 60 countries during my career and stayed at some of the best signature hotels in the world. “What you see as Mbano Hotel today is the culmination of this experience, yet engineered by an expert design and architecturial team to blend with our natural environment. Attention to detail defines the Mbano experience,” said the eloquent and bold Dr Nyazema. “We complement the existing accommodation product in and around Victoria Falls. Our aim is to open up new and additional markets for the benefit of the destination and the country.” One of the trends driving the future of luxury travel is the shift in values from the material to the experiential. “Rather than saving up to buy luxurious possessions, people are choosing to spend their money on experience. Mbano Manor is positioning itself to take up this opportunity in Zimbabwe and the region,” said Dr Nyazema, who is a devoted Christian and is married to Professor Norman Nyazema Another milestone for the hotel is that local pension funds funded its development, over and above the initial injection of feasibility funding that was provided by an international investor. “We applaud and are grateful for the demonstration of confidence by local institutions. In particular, Hippo Valley and Triangle Pension Funds, who endorsed our vision considering this was an entrpreneurial venture,” she said. “Additional funding was also later obtained from the Standard Chartered Pension fund, and from two Minerva pension funds.” Dr Nyazema said the journey to deliver a world class product was not easy and she and her family faced many challenges but remained focused on their goal. Belief in her vision was key to her success. “We didn’t compromise on developing the hotel product that was initially envisaged. My research and experience in tourism convinced me that there is a market gap in the luxury boutique product at Victoria Falls that Mbano can fill. Several people said this idea would not fly because the site is not next to the Zambezi River nor the Rainforest. My global perspective said it was possible,” she said. Dr Nyazema paid tribute to her family and their small staff complement for the support towards realising the vision as well as Governement for assisting in making key breakthroughs. "

GOVERNMENT has engaged China to facilitate the return of experts and engineers stuck in that country since the outbreak of Covid-19 to ensure speedy completion of capital projects being implemented in the country, President Mnangagwa said yesterday. Speaking on the second day of his tour of coal projects here, President Mnangagwa said big projects like the Hwange Power Station Unit 7 and 8 expansion and the Gwayi-Shangani Dam project, which had been stalled by the pandemic, will get required expertise to carry on. He said most engineers had returned to China in January for their country’s New Year holiday and failed to return after countries imposed lockdowns and grounded flights to prevent the transmission and spread of the pandemic. The President said the facility will see the experts being flown in a dedicated flight and quarantined at the respective projects that they are attached to so that they continue with work afterwards. “A few days ago, I had discussions with the Chinese Ambassador and we came to an understanding where we can now airlift most of the experts who are detained in China as a result of the pandemic to come to Zimbabwe to the various companies to which they are attached and then they will go through their quarantine at the respective companies,” said President Mnangagwa. “We believe that Hwange Unit 7 and 8 again will have the level of expertise and competencies it requires made available.” President Mnangagwa kicked off his tour at Dinson Colliery before moving to ZZCC and Zambezi Gas and Makomo Resources. He concluded his tour by visiting ZZEE where he witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the company and Zimbabwe Mining Development Cooperation. “The future is brighter than the past because the Government is giving focus on the mining sector. We have given ourselves goals to achieve in the mining sector. We have agreed that we need to move from US$2 billion to US$12 billion in the sector in the next three years,” said President Mnangagwa. “We are satisfied that we can achieve that goal and possibly exceed what we have set ourselves.” President Mnangagwa said he was happy that indigenous owned mines like Makomo Resources and Zambezi Coal and Gas were doing well. He said Makomo Resources in particular resources would play a key role in providing input into Unit 7 and 8 as a top supplier to the power station. The President called in the two indigenously owned mines to stop quarrelling over the use of a road that passes through Makomo Resources, giving them up to the end of the month to find a common understating, failure to which the Government would intervene. President Mnangagwa (second right) and his delegation visits Zambezi Gas company during his tour of Matabeleland North coal and gas mining companies “Be assured from me that as long as you remain focused and patriotic to your country, you have my Government’s support. All what you need now is a roadmap for expansion and to do so yes, you will need private capital to assist you but you also need us in the public sector in your programmes in order to support you in your set goals,” said the President. President Mnangagwa reiterated that the mining and agricultural sectors were critical in achievement of Vision 2030 as the country has competitive advantage in these segments “Those of our people in mining and agriculture be aware that we as Government are looking on you, are depending on you in particular to achieve our goal. In general, all other sub sectors of the economy must contribute towards that achievement but because with regard to mining everything is here, agriculture, the agricultural land is at our disposal and we have sovereign ownership of land and resources and it is us who determine how we exploit that resource,” he said. Despite persistent drought conditions, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe has an excess of 10 000 water bodies to sustain a vibrant irrigation model but expressed dismay that only 25 percent are being used. He revealed that there is a massive irrigation programme on the cards to ensure full utilisation of the water bodies and that in the next two to three seasons the country would no longer experience food insecurity. President Mnangagwa said countries like Spain and Belarus were supporting Zimbabwe in agriculture mechanisation and that going forward the country must have no excuse for food shortages. For the Government to achieve food security it needs to assist farmers towards smart agriculture, he added. “We must begin to move forward on the basis of the things that are under our control, the pace and the speed is determined by ourselves . . . We can force production of coal because its ours, we can force the production of food because the land is ours,” said the President. To achieve this, President Mnangagwa stressed the need for the country to be united and remain peaceful. “Let us all feel we are wanted and important and we have commitment to the development of our country. Let us all be patriotic to the development of our country because no one will come from elsewhere to develop it,” he said. The President also took time to address Zanu-PF supporters who had gathered at Dinson Colliery and ZZEE telling them that the investors would also work towards the uplifting of communities. He said he visited China in 2018 and his counterpart Xi Xinping invited companies interested in working in Zimbabwe. “They will also build you schools, roads, clinics and also provide clean water to uplift the communities on top of employing the local youths,” he said. Meanwhile, President Mnangagwa donated 2000 tonnes of coke peas he was given by Makomo Resources to Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo. He also directed Matabeleland North Minister for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Richard Moyo to distribute one million bricks, also given to him by Makomo Resources, to the local community in consultation with chiefs and councils for developmental projects. The President was accompanied by Ministers of Mines and Mining Development Winston Chitando, Finance and Economic Development Professor Mthuli Ncube, Environment Climate Tourism and Hospitality Industry Nqobizitha Ndlovu, Industry and Commerce Dr Sekai Nzenza and Women Affairs, Community and Small and Medium Enterprises Development Dr Sithembiso Nyoni. On Thursday, the President toured Western Coal and Energy Company, the new South Mining Coke Plant, Jinan/Tutu Coke Project and Hwange Colliery Company’s Chaba Mine. "

PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has said he is convinced that realising an upper middle-income economy by 2030 is possible as he expressed confidence that new mining investments in Hwange, Matabeleland North Province, will transform the lives of local communities. Speaking during a tour of coal mining companies here yesterday, the President said developmental challenges facing the province and other parts of the country, could easily be solved if private sector players and local communities play ball by partnering with Government in championing development progress. President Mnangagwa, who toured Western Coal and Energy Company, the new South Mining Coke Plant, Jinan/Tutu Coke Project and Hwange Colliery Company’s Chaba Mine, said the new dispensation’s drive was to bring about inclusive growth that is anchored on empowerment of local communities. Traditional leaders were also part of the proceedings. Hwange District alone has seen expansion of mining investments in the last few years with growing focus on diversification towards coal value addition and energy generation, which are set to enhance export prospects and job opportunities. Creating a competitive business environment, expanding the job market and increasing domestic incomes and exports are the hallmark of the Second Republic, said the President. Such a path, he said, could yield the desired economic self-sufficiency that is informed by optimum use of natural resources available in the country. As such, he said yester-year burdens, which have seen places like Hwange and other parts of the country lag behind in terms of development, must be ruthlessly overcome. The President commended the Minister of Mines and Mining Development, Winston Chitando, and his portfolio for boldly pitching a US$12 billion mining target by 2023, as a build up towards towards Vision 2030, saying this drive has to be fully supported with equal enthusiasm by other sectors. “Our desire is to achieve higher middle income by 2030. No doubt, we will achieve the vision we have set but this won’t be achieved by mining alone but all sectors. “I’m happy that in the exploitation of resources in this area, the companies here are doing their best to recruit young people in this area to be given jobs and acquire artisanal skills that are critically important,” said President Mnangagwa. “We must see the change of lives of the local communities because the resource is here. Yes, of course, the country will benefit but we must see also that this area changes and responds to the growth and modernisation of this area. “What is left is for the minister and your people and the companies to deliver what they are telling us.” While Government remains committed to supporting every developmental effort, the President said, private sector support is critical in unlocking wider economic opportunities in respective districts and provinces where companies operate from. “We need those in Government and private sector and communities around to all pull in one direction, in unison,” said President Mnangagwa. “National challenges are not for Government alone but all of us working towards betterment of lives of our people. “Hwange is somewhat behind in terms of infrastructure development. We need no area to be behind.” He called on coal mining companies here to address challenges of water, social amenities like schools and clinics, and road infrastructure as part of their corporate social responsibility. The President said the growing coal mining investments should also assist the country in tackling persistent energy generation shortages, which continue to negatively impact on productive sector. Zimbabwe is currently importing electricity due to a deficit in the local generation of power, yet the country has resources to generate that power. Reliance on imports also drains the economy of scarce forex earnings. On this concern, President Mnangagwa said a roadmap has been set to increase domestic capacity with a view to generating surplus in the short to medium term while also harnessing opportunity around fuel supply and local gas production. Invictus Energy is already exploring prospects for oil in Muzarabani while efforts to tap into vast gas reserves in Lupane are also underway. “We need to access modern technology to convert that gas to our use as well as through the coal processing levels and gas in the country. By 2030 we should be self-sufficient when it comes to fuel. Competencies and skills of doing that are there in the market and we should attract them,” said President Mnangagwa. Despite successive drought seasons that have affected the country due to climate change, President Mnangagwa also bemoaned the fact that Zimbabwe was importing food, stressing the need for adoption of technology and irrigation driven options to utilise the vast tracts of arable land and water bodies to enhance farm production. “We need to produce our own food and feed ourselves. A programme relating to achieving food security is now on course and we have put up a package to support that vision and we believe that within two to three seasons, we should achieve food sufficiency or food security in Zimbabwe. We do not need to import any food at all in Zimbabwe,” he said. “We have adequate electricity and enough fuel in the country. I see no constraint in us achieving what we have set for ourselves; the attainment of higher middle-income status by 2030. All that is needed is focus, stability, harmony and unity in the country and peace. With that we will achieve our goal. We will change the lives of our people. Now can we walk the talk. That is the message throughout.” In his welcome remarks, Matabeleland North Minister for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Richard Moyo expressed appreciation to President Mnangagwa for steering new development projects in the area while making sure that long outstanding ones are completed. He urged investors to consider employing locals while considering environmental issues in their operations. President Mnangagwa and his ministerial delegation comprising Ministers Moyo, Chitando, Dr Sekai Nzenza (Industry and Commerce), Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu (Environment Climate Tourism and Hospitality) continue with the company tours today.

https://www.chronicle.co.zw/binga-gets-26m-devolution-funds/,Binga gets $26m devolution funds,"Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Reporter BINGA Rural District Council has embarked on several capital projects after receiving part of the $26 million under the devolution fund from the Government. In an interview recently, Binga RDC chief executive officer Mr Joshua Muzamba said they have so far received $6 million from the Government and the money was channelled towards rehabilitating roads at Lusulu Business Centre, water and sewer reticulation at Binga Centre and constructing clinics and classroom blocks in several parts of the district. “We have to date received $6 million funding from Government under the devolution grants and we are expecting another $20 million for the district. From the $6 million we got, we roofed classroom blocks at 13 schools whose roofs had been blown away by strong                                                                                            winds and we also managed to build a new classroom block at Chibondo in Manjolo ward,” he said.  The council also procured furniture and other consumables for Chipale Clinic in Sinamagonde ward. “We are also in the process of building two houses for teachers at the same school. We have also built a clinic wing at Malaliya Clinic and erected a perimeter fence and constructed two nurses’ houses. We will do water reticulation and operationalise the clinic in May.” Mr Muzamba said the devolution funds were also used to improve rural service centres in the district.  “We also did water and sewer reticulation at Binga Centre at Govera high density suburb. We also did road rehabilitation at Lusulu Business Centre including other service centres such as Lusulu, Mlibizi, Siabuwa and Manjolo,” he said. “We also did road rehabilitation and created a new road network at Lusulu Business Centre,” he said. Mr Muzamba said the road linking Binga Centre and Siabuwa Road has been rendered inaccessible after Chininga Bridge in Nsungwale area was extensively damaged by floods, which were preceded by heavy rains that lashed the district last month. “The road is generally not trafficable. We are appealing to the Government to upgrade it because as a local authority we only do feeder roads but for the economic movement of goods and services we will need trunk roads to be established,” he said. The council set aside a budget of $62 million for 2020, but in terms of developmental projects, the district is lagging behind especially in social infrastructure like schools and clinics. Mr Muzamba said the remaining $20 million under the devolution grant will go towards construction of more schools and clinics. “We will also do water reticulation for Manjolo because we anticipate it to grow especially when Binga Centre is turned into a local board as we are moving in that direction. So, we have to provide water services for commercial purposes. We are therefore working on ensuring that we have the required infrastructure like water and sewer reticulation,” he said. “We think in a year or two we should be having Binga Centre turned into a local board on its own. We are hopeful that in the next two years, we should have put up a sound refuse collection system, an adequate water and reticulation system.” According to the 2012 census, Binga Centre has a population of 10 000 people. The district has a total of 18 health institutions in its 25 wards. Mr Muzamba also expressed concern over the human-wildlife conflict, which he attributed to the growing populations. “We are having human settlements encroaching into formerly designated wildlife areas resulting in elephants, hippos and buffaloes straying into the fields of surrounding communities. We also witnessing an increase in attacks by crocodiles especially on the fishermen and we have reaction teams from council assisted by ZimParks and Forestry Commission,” he said. – @mashnets "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-adopts-new-agric-recovery-strategy/,Zimbabwe adopts new agric recovery strategy,"Business Reporter GOVERNMENT has adopted a new conservation agriculture model called, Pfumvudza/Intwasa, that seeks to increase household food security across provinces through commercialising small holder farming. Developing robust agriculture value chains and channelling adequate support to specialised farming segments are at the heart of the model, which is expected to assist the country to trim the food import bill.  The model involves holing out and mulching on farms to boost output in light of the continued reduction in crop production. Like most countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region and beyond, Zimbabwe has not been spared from the adverse effects of climate change that have caused output in the agriculture sector to decline. Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister, Perence Shiri, said conservation agriculture modelling was being introduced against a background of continued decline in maize, wheat and soya bean output, which is a threat to national food security. As a result of declining agricultural output, Zimbabwe is spending millions on food imports. “This is against a backdrop of foreign currency shortages and increased global commodity prices. The recovery plan seeks to reverse the negative production trends, attain self-sufficiency and allow the country to move away from perpetual importation of these strategic commodities,” said Minister Shiri in a statement. “Achieving this enables the agriculture sector to occupy its rightful position in steering the country towards attainment of Vision 2030.” Official data shows that drought conditions saw the country’s harvest fall by about 53 percent year-on-year in 2018/19 production season to 800 000 tonnes when compared to 1,8 million tonnes of maize required per year. In the 2020 national budget statement, Treasury indicated that at least 3,7 million were in need of humanitarian food assistance between July 2019  to April 2020. This year’s rainy season has also not been favourable with southern parts of the country, mainly Matabeleland provinces, counting losses of crop failure due to erratic rains. Outside maize, Zimbabwe on average spends US$100 million importing wheat, US$200 million on crude soya oil and about US$100 million on fertiliser products. On average cereals alone gobble about US$500 million. As such, Minister Shiri said the recovery plan was premised on key elements that include Climate Proofed-Presidential Input Support Scheme, financial services sector-led commercial contract farming and the commodity value chain financing model. The Climate Proofed-Presidential Input Support Scheme aims to support 1,6 million vulnerable households to produce maize with standardised input package of 5 kilogramme seed, 50kg basal and 50kg top dressing fertiliser. Minister Shiri said 32kg of basal and top dressing fertiliser can establish two standardised 0,06 hactare-plot each and the two plots can produce over 1 600kg up to 3 200kg of maize grain, enough to feed an average household of five people, leaving surplus. The other plot, he said, would produce surplus for sale and the model intends to address household food security as well as commercialisation of smallholder farming in Zimbabwe. “The farming method adopted on the plots will be the conservation agriculture (Pfumvudza/Intwasa concept, which involves holing out and mulching) and will be standardised throughout the country,” said the minister. “This requires a well capacitated extension system with potential to transform the smallholder sector to produce the country’s food requirements. “This will allow the large farmers to focus on export crops production while 8 500 rural schools will be used as centres of excellence and community centres used to disseminate information on the Pfumvudza concept,” he said. However, Minister Shiri said the programme requires a robust and a well-capacitated extension provision system for technical backstopping, tracking and monitoring. In this light, it is hoped that each extension worker will be required to establish at least a one demonstration plot and given targets to train, track and monitor the adoption of conservation agriculture on 350 households. The demonstration plots will also be established at schools for teaching students as well as used as centres of excellence. “For a farmer to become a beneficiary, all the necessary preparatory activities such as holing out, mulching harvesting by August, should form the criteria.  “Each household is expected to deliver at least 100kg of maize grain as contribution to the Strategic Grain Reserve. The 100kg contribution should unlock package for the next season,” he said. "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/us1-billion-2023-target-set-for-diamond-sector/,US$1 billion 2023 target set for diamond sector,"Pride Mahlangu, Business Reporter MINES and Mining Development Minister, Winston Chitando, says the diamond industry is projected to contribute US$1 billion towards of the targeted US$12 billion mining revenues annually by 2023. Last October, President Mnangagwa launched a strategic roadmap to the achievement of a US$12 billion mining industry by 2023, as Government ramps up efforts to increase the sector’s contribution to the economy by facilitating the exploitation of minerals throughout the entire value chain, with certain targets per mineral. Updating parliament on Wednesday about mining progress, Minister Winston Chitando said the US$12 billion milestone was based on detailed projections and targets. He said US$165 million was realised from the diamond sector in 2019 compared to US$98 million in 2018. As such, the minister said interventions were being put in place to ensure the diamond industry increases output starting this year moving towards achievement of the US$1 billion mark by 2023. “Diamonds are expected to contribute US$1 billion towards the US$12 billion target for the mining industry by 2023,” said Chitando.  “In line with diamond policy, Anjin Investments has started production and Alrosa Diamonds, which is the largest producer of diamonds in the world and is already on the ground evaluating several sites to commence production. Government is working on improvements of the marketing framework.” The minister said the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) was also expected to gradually increase production. On the platinum industry, Minister Chitando said the sector was expected to contribute US$3 billion towards the US$12 billion target by 2023 centred on the expansion and production of projects undertaken by Unki, Zimplats Holdings Limited (Zimplats) and Mimosa Platinum mines.  “Great Dyke investments have started opening a mining area and it is scheduled to produce its first concentrate in 2021. Karo Resources are ready to commence project work on the 1st portal having undertaken extensive evaluation work,” he said.  “Bravura is on the ground undertaking evaluation work. Discussions with Todal Mining Ltd are advanced for them to get into the project phase; actually, they had a board meeting sometime this week.” Minister Chitando said the chrome, nickel and steel sector were earmarked to achieve US$1 billion by 2023, and that the achievement will be necessitated by increased production due to various expansion projects underway by Zimasco, Zim-Alloys, JINAN and AFROSHEEN and a few other players. Recently, Government said mining sector regulations were expected to contribute US$4 billion to the economy this year due to fresh capital injection on new and existing projects. — @pridesinstinctz "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/president-commissions-us15m-irrigation-project/,President commissions US$15m irrigation project,"Samuel Kadungure, Harare Bureau PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday had a hectic programme in Nyanga that saw him officially commission Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme in the morning before addressing a rally at Bumhira Secondary School in the afternoon. The project, which started in 2015, was funded to the tune of US$15 million under the Japanese Grant Aid. The department of irrigation under the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), were involved in the rehabilitation and development of the facility. Nyakomba Phase 2 expansion project included construction of new pumping facilities, improving water level control, distribution and flow measurement. New canal structures were built, while the existing ones were modified. An overnight storage pond was also built while pumps and flood protection structures for Blocks B, C and D pump stations that were damaged by floods in 2006 were also repaired and replaced. New irrigation infrastructure was installed on Block A, which has 146ha.  President Mnangagwa said Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme was one of the most critical irrigation schemes in the country whose modernisation would increase productivity following the rehabilitation and expansion works.   “We came here at the invitation of members of Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme. Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister Perrance Shiri once invited us but we could not make it because of other commitments but this time we have managed to,” said the President while addressing a rally at Bumhira Secondary School later in the day. Cde Mnangagwa said he had come to Nyakomba specifically to see their work that was targeted to sustain livelihoods.  “When we toured the project, we saw men and women The project is targeting export markets, so I had to see where they produce and process it. They export it to America, where they are paid in US dollars,” he explained. The President revealed that the farmers had told him that they earn in excess of US$1 000 from produce grown on their 0, 2 hectare pieces of land but they also produce other crops such as maize and cotton under irrigation supported by the Japanese government. Government, added Cde Mnangagwa, would in the next three years, prioritise construction of dams and drilling of boreholes with a view to put 100 000 hectares under irrigation. This initiative will be implemented in all districts in the country. Meanwhile, President Mnangagwa also took the war on coronavirus to the gathering, where he reiterated that Government was taking all necessary precautions against the coronavirus.  “There is an outbreak of the coronavirus disease worldwide, which has seen only a few countries from the African continent remain unaffected. Thousands of people have died, while many others are sick so we have taken measures as a country so that if we record a positive case we will be ready to deal with it. We thank our God that we have not recorded any case of the virus up to now that I might know.  “We were supposed to host the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in April but this disease does not want people to congregate because if one of them is infected, he or she can pass it on to all those that he or she comes into contact with,” he said.  And since ZITF attracts a lot of people, which increases the chances of the disease spreading, Government has seen it fit to move it to a later date other than in April so it will be hosted once the disease is confirmed over, said the President. He also added that the independence celebrations that had been slated for Bulawayo had been shelved. President Mnangagwa said he had deliberately set March 20 as the date on which his directive for people to avoid gatherings in excess of 100 would come into effect because of yesterday’s event. “The ban will come into force on Friday (tomorrow) so people can still congregate up to Thursday (today) and not breach the ban hence you have the permission to gather as you have done here today,” said the President. He took the opportunity to advise people that schools would remain open till the end of the term. He said Government would also distribute the new batch of Zupco buses to provinces to ease transport problems in rural areas. President Mnangagwa promised to repair all damaged roads and bridges in Chimanimani and Nyanga districts, adding that 33 new buses would be given to civil servants.  The President also warned party supporters against the imposition of candidates during the ongoing restructuring exercises. Cde Mnangagwa later donated laptops (10 per school) to Avilla Secondary School, Regina Coeil Secondary, Nyakomba Secondary, Chatindo Secondary, Bumhura Secondary Schools (all Nyanga), Dewedzo (Makoni), Stirkroem (Chipinge), St David’s Bonda (Mutasa) and Chikuvire Primary School for use under the e-learning initiative. Schools from Nyanga received 1 000 exercise books and sporting kits. The President also donated 90 tonnes of rice to Nyanga South and Nyanga North constituencies. "
