https://www.herald.co.zw/chevrons-get-consolation-t20i-win/,Chevrons get consolation T20I win,"Zimpapers Sports Hub ZIMBABWE’S over-reliance on the batting of captain Sikandar Raza was cruelly exposed in the just ended five-match T20 International series against hosts, Bangladesh. An eight-wicket win with nine balls to spare in the final game yesterday ensured that Zimbabwe put something on the board and avoided a humiliating series whitewash. Zimbabwe’s consolation victory coincided with the first match Raza scored runs. The Chevrons’ T20I skipper flopped in the opening four matches and Zimbabwe found themselves starring a series whitewash going into yesterday’s match. All four defeats were a result of Zimbabwe batsmen, especially Raza and the top order, failing to score runs. When Raza got it right, Zimbabwe lost just two wickets chasing 158. After winning the toss, Raza sent Bangladesh to bat and the hosts made 157/6 off their 20 overs with a topscore of 54 from Mohammad Mahmudullah while Bennett claimed two wickets for 20 in three overs and Blessing Muzarabani taking two for 22 in four overs. Mahmudullah took to the crease with Bangladesh struggling at 15 for 3 and he used the opportunity to push for a solid role in Bangladesh’s team for the ICC T20 World Cup. Mahmudullah shared a 69-run fourth wicket stand with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, who made 36. In reply, Zimbabwe lost Tadiwanashe Marumani for one in the fifth over. Raza was unbeaten on 72 runs off 46 balls when victory was achieved while opener Brian Bennett was named player-of-the-match for 70 runs in 49 balls with the bat and the two wickets for 20 with the  ball. Raza and Bennett featured in a 75-run partnership for the second wicket while the skipper and Jonathan Campbell were unbeaten on 45 in a third wicket stand when victory was achieved. Bennett believes yesterday’s victory should be a good foundation for the future as a number of young players join the Chevrons. “Very grateful for today. We came close in the last game but I am really happy for the team to go back with a victory, obviously not what you want from the series but a good effort from the team today. We have been backed and supported by the coaching staff. We have few youngsters in the team so I think we still have some time so let’s see what happens in the future,” he said. Raza was relieved to have finally found a solution to the batting nightmare. “It’s nice to go home with a win. Like we said in the last three games we were working our way closer and closer to the victory margin. It’s nice to contribute. In the last presentation I came here and said the only jigsaw puzzle that’s missing is me scoring runs. “If I can contribute towards the succession of the team it will give me immense pleasure. And today is one of those days. It’s always nice to contribute towards the winning of the side. When we were losing on those little margins, I thought that was on me. But Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God). “A lot of positives, I lost the series 4-1 but I can say that a lot of positives and we have something to work on for the future of the T20I cricket for Zimbabwe. I am very proud of the squad and I am sure these young guns will take Zimbabwe forward.” "
https://www.herald.co.zw/hollick-crowned-fbc-zim-open-champ/,Hollick crowned FBC Zim Open champ,"Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter GOLFER Michael Hollick kicked off his birthday week in style after he beat a strong field to lift the 2024 FBC Zimbabwe Open Golf championship for the first time at Royal Harare yesterday afternoon. Hollick, who turns 37 on Wednesday, needed to summon all his golf prowess yesterday to finish with a 20-under-par 268 after an epic final day against South African compatriot Darren Fichardt, who pushed him to the limit with his 18-under-par 270. Zimbabwe’s top professional Scott Vincent was in third place with a respectable 14-under after a feisty last two days on the greens. His brother Kieran Vincent also put up a commendable show, tied for fourth place with Swedish golfer Frederick From. Another Zimbabwean Ben Follett-Smith was sixth on 11-under while highly rated Zimbabwean golf prodigy Matthew Bramford, was the top amateur after finishing on 38th place with a course par score 288. But as has become the norm, it was the South African golfers who dominated the event. Hollick, who won his second Sunshine Tour title with the FBC Zimbabwe Open success, was excited to be on the winning podium, six years after he last participated in the Harare event. “It’s always amazing to be here. I haven’t been here since Covid-19, so coming back was nice and the golf course hasn’t changed in the last five years. “It’s always brilliant from the first time I played here in 2011. So I am very pleased,” he said. The 36-year-old had to hold off competition from compatriot Fichardt with six birdies for his final round 66. Hollick had a one-stroke lead going into the final round after he had followed up his first two rounds of 66 and 67 with an impressive 68 in the third round on Saturday, leaving him on 15-under-par. He had a bogey on the 11th hole but the script still went his way yesterday with a crucial birdie in the 17th as Fichardt was dented by two bogeys on the second and 11th holes, despite also carding six birdies on the final day. “It was great,” said Hollick. “I have been lucky enough to play a lot of tournament golf with Darren over the years and he is one hell of a player. So I knew he wasn’t going to give it to me today and I had to go out and win it. Fortunately, I had the goods and I produced it in the end. “And, the biggest thanks go to the fans here; to the crowd that was out, here thank you so much. You really make the most incredible environment for us to play. “I also want to thank Royal Harare Golf Club for hosting us. The golf course was absolutely amazing and I can’t thank you guys enough. “I also want to thanks Darren Fichardt, it was a hell of a battle today. We had a good go out there and well-played,” said Hollick. For the umpteenth time, the Zimbabwe Open Golf title evaded the locals who were left waiting for their breakthrough 24 years since Mark McNulty became the last Zimbabwean to win it in 2000. Scott Vincent reignited Zimbabwe’s hopes for the better part of yesterday but his five-under 67 was not enough to give the top two South Africans a jolt as he settled in third place. His brother Kieran had started the day as the best placed Zimbabwean on 11-under par but he failed to continue with the momentum from the previous day. Bogies on the eighth, 10th and 13th holes came at a huge cost for the younger Vincent. Scott Vincent said the course was tough and will try again next year to challenge for the Zimbabwe Open. “The Sunshine Tour is always strong,” he said. “They always play really tough and obviously it’s good to have them come here and play and it was fun to play JC Ritchie. He is a fantastic player, he played on the world stage. “So all in all it’s a strong field and it’s good to be here. I would love to come back and play every year. We have just to see the scheduling and how it all works out,” said Scott Vincent. Sunshine Tour tournament director Gary Todd was thrilled by the successful hosting of the R2.5 million FBC Holdings-sponsored event. “On behalf of the Sunshine Tour I can’t thank FBC Holdings enough, it was such a fantastic event. “It would be rude of me not to mention the Royal Harare Golf Club course staff who have preserved the facility this week in the most outstanding condition. “To the people of Harare, who have come out and supported us during this magical week, I can’t believe it has gone so quickly and we won’t see you for another year, it’s too long,” said Todd.

There were three bubbles in place with Harare District dominating in the capital, ZDF walking tall in Masvingo while Harare City showed class in Marondera. But it was ZDF who stole the show in Masvingo where hordes of fans made their way to witness top-tier netball spectacle in their town for the first time. Inspired by Gems Goal Shooter Sharon Bwanali, ZDF put newcomers St P&P to the cleaners in a 142-7 punishing scoreline. They had been stretched to their last gear by rivals Black Rhinos who they finally managed to beat 54-41 in the bubble’s tightest duel. Without former champions Platinum Queens and Ngezi Platinum who have reportedly disbanded as well as Greenfuel whose fate is still unknown, ZDF could be just on their way to winning the title though it’s still early days yet. Bwanali, who was mobbed by Masvingo fans who were used to seeing her on television said ZDF need to stay grounded. “We might be on top of the situation and on top of everyone but we need to be cautious and remain focused,” she said. “Last year we finished fourth and we need to change that. “We know there are so many teams like Harare District, Black Rhinos and, Stormers, Harare City, who are doing well and can challenge us at the top so we need to keep on working very hard.” In Marondera, Harare City beat Waterfalls 70-16 before they accounted for Zupco 55-33 in another exciting game while Stormers also came out unscathed when dismissing Waterfalls 62-29 and Marondera 62-28. Harare District were the toast of the capital beating High Fliers 45-32 while Mutare City dismissed 7Flames 49-37 in the same bubble.

Early goals by FC Platinum, that came in  a flash, inside 10 minutes was all that separated the teams. FC Platinum opened the scoring in two minutes of play through Juan Mutudza, who positioned himself well to finish off a coordinated passage of play. Highlanders’s defence was caught off guard and exposed their goalkeeper, Raphael Pitisi, who dived the wrong way and let in a beauty of a shot. In the opening five minutes, Highlanders tried to raid the platinum miners with fast-paced attcks but the visitors’ defence was alert, shutting out the efforts. FC Platinum had the first corner, just in 10 minutes of play, Mutudza curled it and Lawrence Mhlanga rose high and nodded the second goal. That is all FC Platinum needed to collect maximum points. Highlanders were not in their usual form and the trusted defensive line,  led by captain Peter Muduhwa, was porous. After the second goal, Bosso attempted to regain composure and Mvelo Khoza’s thunderbolt went wide. Godfrey Makaruse, who was drafted in to replace Archford Faira, was fouled on the left lank by Hagiazo Magaya. However, Mbeba skied the free-kick. Bosso’s first corner came in the 30th minute. Prince Ndlovu took the kick but found no takers at goal. Another corner kick came and Andrew Mbeba was trusted to pass it through, instead, the ball was blocked by Platinum’ Rainsome Pavari. For Highlanders, the absence of the ever creative Melikhaya Ncube, who was serving a one-match suspension, was felt. At the 37th minute, Bosso had the chance to reply but McKinnon Mushore’s shot hit the upright post, with the rebound landing on Prince Ndlovu’s boots but he shot wide. In the opening 15 minutes of the second half, Highlanders had opportunities to hit back but Lynoth Chikuhwa fluffed them, while FC Platinum could have netted their third goal through Hagiazo Magaya. In the end, Kaindu rued the absence of Melikhaya. “We were unsettled in the first 10 minutes that we conceded two goals and it is always difficult to come back, especially against a team like FC Platinum. I think Melikhaya’s absence could have affected us. “We didn’t convert chances that came our way. Our opponents scored utilised the chances they got. Even in the second half we looked a bit stronger but unfortunately we couldn’t get the goals in terms of converting the chances that we had created. FC Platinum coach, Norman Mapeza, was a happy man. He was honest enough to say he did not expect the victory, given Bosso’s legacy at Barbourfields and their record so far. “It was a good game of football. I said it before, it was all to do with controlling the game in the opening minutes and that’s exactly what we did. We had some good opportunities to increase the lead. Overall it was a good game,” said Mapeza. “I told the guys that in the first 15 minutes they were going to come at us. It worked well as we needed to defend with four players at the back and made sure there were no crosses coming in between. Well done to my boys, they did exactly what we did at training,” said Mapeza. Teams: Highlanders: R. Pitisi, D. Mhindirira (Chigonero 66 minutes) , L. Chikuhwa, M. Mushore, P. Ndlovu, G.

Blessing Ngazima and Gift Mwinga scored the goals that broke the home team fans’ hearts. The Gweru Premiership returnees have not won a game in their last six outings and the fans feel the team has disappointed after garnering 11 points from as many games. After the game yesterday, the irate TelOne supporters assembled outside the dressing rooms and had to be dispersed by the police who calmed the situation. Chikuni blamed his team for the defeat, but the fans’ reaction was a clear indication that they were disappointed with his performance. On the other hand, Chegutu Pirates coach Emmanuel Day Gutu breathed a sigh of relief as his team scored a goal in each half. The Premiership newboys marched into Bata Stadium with the sole aim of proving themselves as a force to be reckoned with. They got an early goal from a free kick in the fifth minute after Reginald Ngazima was fouled just outside the box. Gift Mwinga stepped up and curled a brilliant shot that beat TelOne goalkeeper Matshazi Thabiso all systems out. TelOne piled on the pressure in search of an equaliser with their star man Blessing Sahondo leading the quest but their found the Pirates defence that was well marshalled by Reuben Machaya in an uncompromising mood. After the half-time break, visiting coach Gutu introduced Russel Chifura, Tinotenda Ditima and Tinashe Mavhudzi to add flair to his side. The trio gelled immaculately, supplying a neat pass to Cleopas Dube who complemented it with an impish low header to increase the tally midway through the second half. After the final whistle, an elated Gutu gave credit to his players for the tough away win. “I’m a relieved man. As you can see, we were sitting in a precarious position on the league table.” “The win is a real boost as we are travelling to face Bikita Minerals away next week.” Gutu expressed gratitude towards their loyal supporters who have been with the team in every match, regardless of their performance.

https://www.herald.co.zw/nakambas-luton-concede-epl-demotion/,Nakamba’s Luton concede EPL demotion,"LONDON. — Injured Warriors captain, Marvelous Nakamba will resume action in the English Championship after his Luton Town lasted just one season in the English Premiership. Nakamba was ruled out for the rest of the season following injury in December and was not able to help the club survive relegation, which was virtually confirmed on Saturday. Luton Town boss Rob Edwards said the Premier League was “just a bit too much” for his side after a 3-1 loss away at West Ham United all but sealed his team’s relegation. Luton have struggled to find their feet in their first season in England’s top flight since 1992, having won just one in 16 in the league, and not registered an away league win in 2024. “We didn’t get relegated because of today, it was a culmination of the whole season. Today was the difficult day but we’ve been on an incredible journey. I’m just really disappointed that I’m the one responsible,” he told reporters. Edwards praised his side’s performance in the first half, where Luton went into the break 1-0 up thanks to a sixth-minute header from Belgian midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga. “We showed some really good things to go 1-0 up . . . we showed at times we’ve got quality to get behind them and get into good areas,” he told reporters. West Ham’s quality proved too much for the Hatters in the second half, and a much-improved performance from the home side saw goals from James Ward-Prowse, Tomas Soucek and George Earthy dealt a hammer blow to Luton’s hopes of survival. “Credit to them, they’ve got some really good players and we came up short,” Edwards added. Luton were not officially relegated on Saturday after Nottingham Forest lost 3-2 to Chelsea, but it will take a final day miracle for them to survive. They host Fulham on the final day of the season needing to overcome a three point and 12 goal-difference deficit to 17th placed Forest, who visit already relegated Burnley. Luton have won the respect of rival teams and fans alike this season with their style of play and approach, having risen all the way from the Conference — England’s fifth tier — in the last 10 years to achieve a place in the Premier League for this season. West Ham fans applauded Luton’s players off the pitch at the end of the match, which Edwards said was “touching”. “At times I think we’ve shown that we can compete with loads of teams, with everybody, and the growth and the improvement, I take pride in that,” he said. “I’ve loved it, and it fuels the fire to get back in.” Luton have struggled to compete financially with other teams in the Premier League this year and have spent far less than any other club according to Transfermarket. “We got promoted with one of the smallest budgets… It was a huge gap, chasm, between us and the Premier League. That won’t necessarily be the case now, we can be one of the stronger teams.” With Sheffield United and Burnley already relegated, it would be the first time since the 1997-1998 season that all three promoted teams go straight back down. Edwards said they wanted to go out in style against Fulham on the final day. “We want to try and go out on a high and show the best us, we owe that to our supporters, ourselves, and the league.” —Reuters/Sports Reporter.

(0) 1 Bikita Minerals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   0 MANICA Diamonds eased to the summit of the Castle Lager Premiership table after winning their seventh match on the trot, this time a 1-0 win over Bikita Minerals at Sakubva Stadium yesterday. Impressive Micheal Tapera’s 66th minute strike, his fifth goal in as many matches, was all the diamond miners needed to dismiss their opponents in this pulsating encounter that had all the ingredients of a derby.  In fact, the consistent Manica Diamonds left winger has been the main man behind Manica Diamonds’ resurgence, with his second half introduction, together with Charles Teguru on the right, proving too hot to handle for most of their opponents.  The fast-paced encounter started with both teams showing exuberance by creating scoring opportunities. First off the blocks were the lithium miners in the second minute when exciting Chris Makambira was floored just outside the box. Right back, Blessing Kagudu made a mess of the resultant free kick as he directed his effort into the left side netting. The hosts also had a clear cut scoring chance two minutes later when a flat footed yet rightly positioned Panashe Mutasa got to the end of neat exchange of passes but blasted the ball way over the cross bar from close range. The Gem Boys, as Manica Diamonds are fondly referred to by their growing legion of fans, almost surged ahead five minutes after the breather when Micheal Tapera latched on to a loose ball off a rebound and his blistering shot hit the crossbar while an already beaten Bikita Minerals goalkeeper Victor Machopa remained motionless. Tapera was back to torment the visiting side two minutes later when he ghosted from the right to connect Charles Teguru’s cross, but his header missed the target by inches. However, Manica Diamonds finally broke the deadlock in the 64th minute when Fortune Binzi tapped the ball to an unmarked Tapera’s in the box and the later made no mistake as he blasted the ball home to give the hosts the lead. Manica Diamonds coach Tapera acknowledged that the pressure is mounting with each match they continue collecting maximum points. “We have been on a winning streak, and that makes each match more challenging given that every opponent that we now face ups the tempo. “Nonetheless, that is the nature of the game. It comes with pressure with each outing and we just have to compete. I believe so far so good, we have been competing well and we hope to continue collecting maximum points as we go,” said Tapera.  The Manica Diamonds gaffer praised his men for a decent performance. “I am happy with the way we have been defending in all these matches we have won. We have kept a clean sheet and that is commendable. “On the transition to attack, we have also been impressive and that explains the rhythm in our play. It is flowing very well and we will work towards maintaining that,” he said. Bikita Minerals coach Saul Chaminuka was an angry man after the final whistle. The veteran gaffer, who is widely believed to be on his way to Green Fuel this week to take over the role of head coach where he will be assisted by Taurai Mangwiro, was not happy with the match officiating. “There is no way we can develop as a nation in this game with this kind of match officiating. Surely, my players being kicked, even in off the ball situations, but the referee waves play on. It is unfortunate that we coaches when we complain about referees, we are crucified, so I will not comment about this match,” fumed Chaminuka.

Sibanda, who has previously made waves in the Mighty Warriors dugout, showed some clout when leading FC Platinum Royals to a strong finish last season. And she is expected to finally end Chapungu Queens’ wait for a maiden title this season. But she will have to reorganise her charges after they failed to work out a formula to repel champions Herentals Queens, who made history by winning the crown without suffering any defeat last season. The tie was the pick of the league’s opening weekend and it lived up to its billing, with both teams displaying quality in a match that attracted a lot of spectators. Herentals Queens, after missing some good chances just like their opponents in the opening phase, came good through the boot of 2022 Soccer Star of the Year Praynance Zvawanda in the second half. Though Chapungu Queens tried hard to crawl back with the fit-again Ethel Chinyerere rattling the cross-bar, the Simbarashe Dedza side held on to start the defence of their title on a positive note. Sibanda though noted some good signs from her team which she hopes to build ftom going into match day two of the championship. “Herentals are a big team and we are fighting to be in the top there. The aspirations have never changed. “It was a very good game, very physical. I noted a lot of positives from my team,” said Sibanda. “We need to work on some slight things like concentration especially analysing how we conceded. We were winning the second ball and really played well. We just need to make sure that we play well. “This is a marathon, there are still a lot of games to play and a lot of things to fix. We have a very strong squad and we are looking forward to doing well.” Dedza, whose girls will be representing the country in the Women’s CAF Champions League Zonal qualifiers in South Africa in August, said the Students need to maintain the winning spirit. “Chapungu is a very strong team but my girls showed a lot of character,” Dedza said. “This is a long marathon and we need to keep on having the right mentality that helps us get the results.” Elsewhere, Shamaine Kapachi hauled four goals to help FC Platinum Royals dispatch MSU Queens 7-0, while Greater Bhande, Chiedza Paraganda and Kudakwashe Basopo grabbed a hattrick each to help their teams to comfortable wins. Bhande got three goals in Black Rhinos’ 7-0 win over ZRP Harare, with Paraganda’s triple strikes seeing Conduit sprint over the line against Hope Academy in a 5-0 victory for the Guruve team.

Far side assistant referee Kudzanai Hiya, who flagged Herentals’ Dreamer Liye’s opener for offside with 27 minutes on the clock, again raised his flag when Donald Dzvinyai appeared to have secured the points for Dynamos. With DeMbare players sprinting to celebrate and later confront Hiya, Herentals quickly started play and as they were going clear of goal, the Dynamos bench, led by goalkeepers’ coach Britto Gwere rushed into the pitch to curtail the attack. Apart from the controversy of disallowed goals, the  ‘dirty’ match was characterised by crude tackles and every aspect of tension. After missing an array of chances in the opening half hour, Nomore Chinyerere broke the ice with a fortuitous finish, benefiting largely from poor goalkeeping by Takudzwa Chikosi, who fumbled the tame effort letting it slide in between his legs, with 31 minutes played. With the Glamour Boys tiding things up to the break, they had no answers to the Students’ raids, with substitute Milton Chimedza coming to the end of Tino Benza’s cross after 66 minutes. Dynamos gaffer Genesis Mangombe decried his team’s failure to utilise their opportunities. “We should try and make sure that we score goals whenever we get chances. I think we got so many chances in the first half, but we failed to score,” said Mangombe. “Some of these decisions are costing us at the end of the day, but I am not a referee. “If it’s a goal, it’s a goal. Even in their (Herentals) goal, I thought there was an infringement on Jalai (Emmanuel). “We scored a clear goal, but it was disallowed.” His Herentals counterpart, Paul Benza, said he was not qualified to comment about match officiating although Liyeto’s first half goal appeared to be legitimate. “I don’t qualify to comment about match officials,” said Benza. “The game was good and I thought my players did very well. “I am happy and disappointed at the same time. I think we should have won this match but it is some of those things that happen in football. “But the fighting spirit from my lads was amazing.” Dynamos should have opened the scoring inside 19 minutes but Elton Chikona failed to direct his effort well when shrugging his markers inside the box. Five minutes later, Donald Mudadi managed a low shot but it was parried away by Chikosi.  Herentals took their points tally to 11 while DeMbare are now on 12 points, eight behind leaders Manica Diamonds.

Leandro Trossard scored the only goal on 20 minutes as Arsenal won for just the second time in 17 games away at United to go a point clear at the summit. Manchester City still have the destiny of the title in their own hands as the defending champions have two matches left to Arsenal’s one. However, the Gunners kept the pressure on Pep Guardiola’s men ahead of their tricky trip to Tottenham on Tuesday. Defeat further dented United’s chances of competing in Europe next season. Erik ten Hag’s men showed more spirit than in a dismal 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday, but have now won just one of their last eight Premier League games. United remain eighth in the table, three points adrift of both Newcastle, who they face on Wednesday, and Chelsea. Arsenal have been in scintillating form in 2024 to remain in the race for their first league title in 20 years. Mikel Arteta’s men have won 15 and drawn one of their 17 league games since the turn of the year. But Arsenal were far from their flowing best as the expected onslaught of an injury-ravaged United never materialised under unusually stifling heat in England’s north-west. The manner of defeat at Palace had increased the scrutiny on United boss Ten Hag. He made three changes to the team swept aside at Selhurst Park as Scott McTominay, Sofyan Amrabat and Amad Diallo came in. The Dutchman’s options were again hamstrung by a lengthy list of absentees with captain Bruno Fernandes among those sidelined and a bench littered with youngsters. But his decision to retain Casemiro as a makeshift centre-back after his woeful showing against Palace will become another stick to beat the beleaguered coach with. The Brazil captain was dropped from their squad for the Copa America in midweek due to his terrible form. After United had managed to keep the free-scoring visitors at bay for the opening 20 minutes, Casemiro was culpable for the opening goal. The 32-year-old was laboured in pushing up from a United goal-kick to play Kai Havertz onside and Trossard then stole in on the blind side of Casemiro to tap in the German’s cross. United’s new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance at Old Trafford rather than at Wembley to see the club’s women pick up their first ever major trophy in the FA Cup final. The work that lies ahead of Ratcliffe has been laid bare in recent weeks, but the home side did manage to keep the majority of the 74 000 crowd onside by taking the game to Arsenal after the break. Arsenal, though, were rarely seriously troubled as they held out for a sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games. Alejandro Garnacho was United’s one live wire but smashed into the side-netting with his best chance to equalise. Gabriel Martinelli and Declan Rice were denied by brilliant Andre Onana saves to prevent Arsenal the second goal they craved to avoid a tense finale. The visitors desperation to see the game out was evident as Martinelli took the ball to the corner with 10 minutes of the 90 still to play. But Arsenal did just enough to ask the question City, who host West Ham on the final day of the season after their visit to north London in midweek. — SuperSport. "

https://www.herald.co.zw/legendary-zim-duo-shines-at-cosafa-awards/,Legendary Zim duo shines at COSAFA awards,"Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN players and officials may not have won any awards at the at the inaugural COSAFA awards in South Africa on Thursday but the country was represented on the podium by legendary former Warriors coach Sunday ‘Mhofu’ Chidzambwa and ex-referee Felix Tangawarima who were honoured with Lifetime Achievement Awards by the Southern African football body. Chidzambwa, who is the most successful coach in COSAFA Cup, was presented with a Lifetime Achievement in Services to Coaching while Tangawarima’s efforts were acknowledged with the Lifetime Achievement in Services to Refereeing. Coming just a few years after retiring from active coaching, Chidzambwa should have found great cheer from the recognition as it is not every day that local officials get such recognition for their efforts. The 72-year-old coach has made extraordinary accomplishments in the COSAFA Cup, where he has won a record four titles and never lost a match outright. The former Dynamos and Zimbabwe captain and coach lifted the COSAFA Cup in 2003, 2009 on home soil and the 2017 and 2018 editions in Rustenburg and Polokwane, South Africa respectively. Only two other coaches, his late young brother Misheck in 2000 and Charles Mhlauri (2005) have ed Zimbabwe to COSAFA glory. Zimbabwe’s six titles are only second to Zambia who hold the record with seven and that is thanks largely to the mentorship of Chidzambwa, who has never been beaten outright in the COSAFA Cup after leading Zimbabwe in 19 matches in the tournament. The veteran coach has been keeping a low profile since he quit his job as Warriors coach in 2019, and from active football coaching a year later. However, the former defender briefly bounced back for a once-off assignment when he led the Warriors against Namibia during the celebrations to mark President Mnangagwa’s inauguration last year. Previously he had several stints with the national team and holds the distinction of being the first to lead the Warriors to their maiden Africa Cup of Nations in 2004. He guided the team to the tournament again in Egypt in 2019. The 72-year-old mentor raked several trophies with Dynamos at the height of his caching career and took the popular club to the final of the 1998 CAF Champions League. It remains the only time that a local club has reached the final of a continental club competition. Tangawarima, a revered figure across the African refereeing fraternity, has done much to develop match officials on the African continent in the last few decades, but especially Southern Africa, and was awarded with a Lifetime Achievement for services to refereeing. Tangawarima, who is now as a CAF senior referees’ instructor, has worked extensively for the development of the refereeing standards in Eastern and Southern Africa. A deeply religious man, Tangawarima paid tribute to his family and his United Methodist Church members for standing by him in long career as a match official. “I would want to thank COSAFA for bestowing me with this prestigious award. “I have all been passionate about doing my job, especially developing and leading the referees throughout the entire continent,’’ Tangawarima said. “But being recognised in this manner is something I will always cherish for years to come. “Again, I would want to thank Zimbabweans in general for the support they have given me over all these years. “Sometimes, they may not know what it means to me when they talk positive things about how I do my work. It always encourages me to continue working hard so that I don’t let them down. “My family has also been a pillar of my strength. “My football family in Zimbabwe and the football association, I cannot do this without belonging to the mother body (ZIFA). “My colleagues at my church Inner City United Methodist Church for all the prayer session they do for me.’’. Tangwawarima said he also felt even more honoured to receive the award in the presence of the Sports and Recreation Commission and the ZIFA Normalisation Committee leadership. “I was humbled to have the chairman of the SRC (Gerald Mlotshwa), the director-general (Eltah Nengomasha), together with commissioners Nigel Munyati and others, the NC chairman Mr Lincoln Mutasa, witnessing the occasion and taking pictures with me, this gave me a huge sense of belonging and being loved. “I also thank the media for always highlighting the work I would have done, which resulted in me getting this award. “I am sure this award will inspire upcoming sportspersons to know that they can do it, with hard work and commitment.’’ Some of the local referees and coaches who have been found wanting in their duties could probably take a leaf from each of Chudzambwa and Tangawarima’s success stories. The awards night, however, belonged mainly to the players and coaches who walked home with various accolades. Held for the first time in the history of COSAFA, the ceremony at the exquisite Sandton Convention Centre on Thursday drew some of the luminaries of the game from this part of the continent and was a platform to celebrate success in 2023. South African striker Percy Tau and Zambian forward Racheal Kundananji took home the best player prizes at the inaugural awards, itself a glittering gala ceremony. COSAFA executive director Sue Destombes said the organisation was proud to have finally put together an event to acknowledge the talent in Southern Africa. “These awards have been a long time coming as we felt there is the need to celebrate our successes as a region and show the togetherness and spirit of Ubuntu that we have among all our COSAFA nations. “We have enormous talent on and off the pitch and while we do acknowledge these winners for their outstanding contributions, we also recognise that there is much more for us to do to unlock the full potential we possess in Southern Africa,” said Destombes.

https://www.herald.co.zw/mapeza-pleads-for-patience-with-refs-ahead-of-bosso-tie/,Mapeza pleads for patience with refs ahead of Bosso tie,"Onward Gangata FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza has pleaded with the local football community to be patient with referees ahead of his side’s top of the table clash against Highlanders at Barbourfields tomorrow. There have been growing concerns over the decline in the standards of match officiating in the local game. In acts of misconduct that only serve to shame the Premiership, two matches have so far been abandoned due to crowd trouble and teams protesting referees’ decisions. FC Platinum’s clash against CAPS United at Mandava was abandoned in the 86th minute with the miners leading 1-0. Mapeza’s men were eventually awarded the points via a disciplinary committee ruling that also slapped CAPS United with a US$4000 fine. Chegutu Pirates have been summoned to a hearing by the PSL following the abandonment of their match against Dynamos at Baobab where the newboys refused to let the game restart as they protested an injury-time goal scored by DeMbare. For all the attacks levelled against the referees, Mapeza, has, however, come out in defence of the match officials. The Zimbabwe skipper and coach, who last year threatened to quit the game over biased officiating, urged patience with the match officials. He argued that the game’s stakeholders needed to also understand that referees are prone to mistakes “like any other humans’’ and that the errors are part of the game. “Everybody should know that in a game of football you win, you lose and you draw,’’ said Mapeza. “Whatever the referees are going to do let us respect that, otherwise if we are not going to respect the referees then there are going to be problems.’’ An explosive encounter is on the cards after FC Platinum eased into third place and a point behind leaders and Manica Diamonds who both have 19 points. Depending on how Manica Diamonds fare in the Eastern Region derby clash with Bikita Minerals, FC Platinum could go top should they overcome Bosso. Mapeza pleaded with the fans, especially, to exercise restraint when protesting referees’ decisions. And Mapeza pleaded with the supporters that even when match officials make grave mistakes, supporters must always exercise restraint. “We have to respect the referees…we saw what happened in that match between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich and was there any crowd trouble? No! “Why can’t we learn from that “Referees are also human, they make mistakes and we should accept that, if we really love our football, we should respect referees’ decisions.’’ Mapeza said. "

Clubs like Border Strikers, Under Hill, and Triple B altogether have had a dance in the PSL before they found themselves relegated to the lower leagues. Now, if the form that has been displayed by Dulibadzimu in ZIFA Central Region Soccer League is anything to go by, the Beitbridge community is hoping they might be having top-flight football back in their community soon. After six games, Dulibadzimu, who are under the guidance of Stanley Ncube, are in pole position with 16 points, four points clear second-placed Dinson Mvuma. Their impressive run consists of five wins and a draw. They are hoping to continue with their unbeaten run tomorrow when they face Blanket Mine away at Long John. In their last encounter, Dulibadzimu edged one of the favourites, Chapungu, by a goal to nil to make a strong case of themselves. But for Dulibadzimu chairman, Ephart Chikweza Shoko, the team is just focusing on improving their game and finish in a better position than they did last season, anything above that is a bonus for them. The club finished sixth last season with TelOne being crowned champions. “As a team, our target is to improve from what we did last season. We finished in position six and we are aiming to finish in a better position this season,” said Shoko. “Honestly, if we gain PSL status, that will be a bonus for us as we are not favourites in this marathon. But it’s best for us to maintain the position if possible, the whole football community of Beitbridge will be happy as it has been long since we have had a team from here in the top-flight. We all remember the past, it was good having our teams playing in PSL and we want to have that feeling again. “As a club we have a way we are doing things, we have trusted in continuity as we have kept the bulk of most of our players from last season and added a few players who we felt they might add value and I think it’s working. “So as the club’s executive of a community team we are just there to make sure that the community of Beitbridge at large is happy and we are ready to deliver what they expect from us,” he said.

The defeat left the Chevrons facing a possible whitewash as they now trail the series 4-0 ahead of the last match of the series tomorrow. After winning the toss yesterday, Zimbabwe elected to bowl first and managed to restrict the hosts to 143 runs in 19.5 overs. The bowling innings became a tale of two halves for the Chevrons, with the first 10 overs being a struggle for Sikandar Raza and his men. Bangladesh put 100 runs on the board after 12 overs without losing a wicket. But they went on to crumble as they lost 10 wickets in the last eight overs of their batting innings. The openers Tanzid Hasan Tamim and Soumya Sarkar provided the hosts with a flying start after putting 101 runs on the board. But Zimbabwe got their first wicket at the start of the 12th over when Hasan (52) was caught out by Jonathan Campbell off a Luke Jongwe delivery. Jongwe was to strike again four balls later, in the same over, dismissing Soumya Sarka (41), which also proved to be a vital wicket for the visitors. The two wickets marked the start of the collapse of the Bangladesh batting line up as they went on to lose eight more wickets for meagre returns. Jongwe bagged his third for the day with Richard Ngarava and Brian Bennet each claiming two wickets apiece while skipper Sikandar Raza and Blessing Muzarabani got a wicket each. Eventually, Bangladesh were bowled out for 143 runs. Zimbabwe had an awkward start chasing their first win in four matches, as Bennet was dismissed with the fourth ball of the innings. Raza was the next to be dismissed in the fourth over for 17 runs off 10 balls. At the half-way mark, chances for Zimbabwe’s first win still looked probable despite the setbacks, as the Chevrons stood at 58 runs for the loss of four wickets. The fourth and fifth wicket partnerships of Clive Madande and Campbell, and Ryan Burl and Campbell gave Zimbabwe some hope before a characteristic Chevrons collapse set in. Wellington Masakadza who has had a good time with the bat in the series, put up another good performance as he scored an unbeaten 19 off just eight balls. His efforts were not good enough for the Chevrons as they went on to lose the match by five runs after the tail was cleaned up for 138 runs in 19.4 overs. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/rheumatic-heart-disease-burden-on-the-rise-in-zimbabwe/,Rheumatic heart disease burden on the rise in Zimbabwe,"Sifelani Tsiko Innovations Editor The rheumatic heart disease, a condition that affects the heart valves, is now the most prevalent heart problem affecting most Zimbabwean patients seeking treatment, a top cardiovascular expert has said. Cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, Dr Wilfred Muteweye told The Herald in an interview that rheumatic heart disease cases are the most common condition they have operated on. “The most common heart disease that we operate on is rheumatic heart disease (RHD). This is when the heart valves are damaged over time due to the body’s reaction to a throat infection,” he said. “Initially the patient has a throat infection in childhood. As the body mobilises the immune system to fight that infection, the antibodies against the infection start to damage the heart valve tissue. The damaged valves then deteriorate overtime (10 – 25 years), resulting in an abnormally functioning heart (and lungs in some cases). The patient then develops chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue, among other symptoms. “Our job is to remove the diseased valve and put in an artificial one. This, if done early enough, will allow for the reversal of symptoms and allow the patient to live life to the full, to have a life expectancy similar to any other people in the population.” This condition arises as valves become damaged due to inflammation in the heart tissue. Experts say the heart valves are important to ensure blood flows through the heart smoothly. They also help prevent the backflow of blood. Damage to the heart valves can cause serious health conditions. Zimbabwean cardiac specialists resumed open heart surgeries early this year. They are targeting to perform 60 free open heart surgeries this year as they scale up efforts to significantly reduce the backlog of people needing treatment. As of December 2023, the team had conducted 22 open heart surgeries. Out of these, three patients died while 19 recovered well. In the first quarter of 2024, Zimbabwean surgeons conducted nine successful heart operations at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, one of the country’s largest referral hospitals. “For 2024, we started at the end of January. We have conducted surgery on nine patients,” Dr Muteweye said. “We currently have three patients at Parirenyatwa Hospital who are recovering from the surgeries. One of them had two valves, which we replaced. She is almost ready for discharge.” Worldwide, about 20 million people suffer from RHD, according to the World Health Organisation. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region in the world and in Southern Africa, 17 out of 1 000 people suffer from RHD. “Heart valve surgery is the only relief for most of them. Sadly, not many Sub – Saharan countries offer cardiac surgery. In addition, cardiac surgeons are in short supply. The ratio of cardiac surgeons to the general population in Africa is ome surgeon per 5 million people, while in the West it is one surgeon per 50 – 100 000 people. In Zimbabwe, we are slightly better than other African countries with one surgeon per 3 million people,” Dr Muteweye said. He said rheumatic heart disease conditions could be prevented through early treatment of childhood throat infections with antibiotics and reducing overcrowding. People more at risk of these infections are in large crowded places such as schools, day care centres or colleges. Anyone can develop rheumatic fever, but it is more common in children aged five to 15 years and it is very rare in children younger than three years old as well as adults. Rheumatic heart disease symptoms vary depending on the severity and extent of the damage to the heart valve. Health experts say in some cases, there may be no symptoms, while in others, they may include pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, swelling of the stomach, hands or feet, fatigue, rapid or irregular heartbeat.

Provincial police spokesperson, Inspector Milton Mundembe said the deceased, Last Mutematsaka, is the accused, Kero Dick’s uncle. Inspector Mundembe said on April 22 this year at around 3 pm, Dick’s mother, Eriza Chiunye (45), drove a herd of cattle into Mutematsaka’s sorghum field. A furious Mutematsaka exchanged words with Chiunye. She went home and told her son about the altercation. Armed with an iron bar, Dick, who was intoxicated, confronted Mutematsaka, accusing him of insulting his mother. He struck Mutematsaka several times on the stomach and groin until he became unconscious. His wife, Maria Chipiwe, rushed Mutematsaka to Chikafa Clinic where he was treated and discharged. The following day, Mutematsaka’s condition deteriorated and he was rushed to Chitsungo Hospital. He died on April 24. Inspector Mundembe appealed to members of the public to solve their differences amicably and avoid resorting to violence. “People need to seek the assistance of mediators or report to the police whenever they face some challenges in resolving disputes,” he said.

The team behind the initiative include Mr Mark Chunga, the founder; Ms Wadzanai Majuru, the operations manager; Ms Natasha Machingura, the programs manager and Mr Munyaradzi Edmore Kashiri, the finance manager. Emphasising on the importance of collaboration, the group has formed partnerships with various organisations and schools to support children with neurological disorders. The disorders, often characterised by a range of physical and cognitive impairments, present substantial challenges for affected children and their families. While these conditions cannot be cured, the youth-led initiative seeks to enhance the affected children’s quality of life through a variety of projects and support systems. Speaking at a press conference over the weekend in Harare, Mr Chunga said the organisation has plans to expand their reach beyond Harare. Their goal is to reach and help as many children with neurological disorders as possible, irrespective of their location. “We have initiated various projects to support and finance this important cause, including a chicken rearing project. Our mission is to bring comfort and relief to the lives of these children and their families, and we are dedicated to making a meaningful impact in their lives,” said Mr Chunga. So far, the Charity Project has distributed wheelchairs, donated food and other items to affected children. The group’s unwavering dedication to this cause has attracted attention and support from various quarters, with many expressing admiration for the selfless initiative taken by these young people. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/zimbabwe-records-nine-open-heart-surgeries-in-first-quarter/,Zimbabwe records nine open-heart surgeries in first quarter,"Sifelani Tsiko Innovations Editor Zimbabwe cardiac specialists have resumed open-heart surgeries at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in the capital, with nine patients benefitting in the first quarter of the year.   Veteran cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, Dr Wilfred Muteweye recently told The Herald that his team has recorded steady progress and is optimistic of realising this year’s target of 60 patients.   “For 2024, we started at the end of January. Just this year we have done nine patients so far. Despite some challenges here and there, I am quite optimistic that we may soon be doing two cases per week once we get reliable and consistent supplies,” he said.   “We are building up gradually. We have been doing one open-heart surgery per week for the past few weeks,” said Dr Muteweye.   Zimbabwean cardiac specialists are targeting to perform 60 free open-heart surgeries this year as they scale up efforts to significantly reduce the backlog of people needing treatment.   As of December 2023, the team had conducted 22 open-heart surgeries. Out of this, three patients died while 19 recovered well.   “We currently have three patients at Parirenyatwa Hospital who are recovering from the surgeries. One of them had two valves replaced. She is almost ready for discharge,” Dr Muteweye said.   “Government continues to support us. None of our patients are paying for the surgeries. We are planning to start doing open-heart surgery for children this year, probably by August,” he said.   Zimbabwe resumed open-heart surgery at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals last year in June after the service was stopped in 2018.   From that year upto 2023, patients in need of open-heart surgery had to fork out huge sums of money to seek treatment in South Africa, India, Kenya, Italy, Sudan and other countries.   A heart operation in India costs anything between US$8 000 to US$15 000, depending on the complexity of the case.   On the other hand, the surgeries being conducted in Zimbabwe are done free of charge.   The country has between 500 and 600 adult patients with rheumatic heart disease awaiting surgery, while every year about 4 000 children are born with congenital heart deformities that need open-heart surgery.   “We have the capacity to conduct these operations and even more complex heart surgeries. We are gradually building our capacity and our team is becoming more efficient,” Dr Muteweye said.   “The operation times are now shorter, that is the time when the patient is on the operating table. The patient’s average stay in the intensive care unit has also become shorter,” he said.   Zimbabwe has a history of heart operations that dates back to 1959.   The first case of an open-heart surgery in Zimbabwe was reported in 1959 when two surgeons, Dr NJ Micklem and Dr GVS Wright, used external body cooling methods to conduct a successful operation on a 15-year-old boy who had a diseased pulmonary valve.   In the 1970s and 1980s, a philanthropic team from Loma Linda University, United States, visited Zimbabwe and did open heart surgeries.   From 1988 to 1992, a local team of specialists was set up to do operations. The open-heart surgery programme became a permanent feature from 1994, run by Dr David Chimuka and Dr William Mahalu and a few others.   However, the programme ceased in 2003 due to lack of foreign currency to purchase consumables after more than 400 patients had benefited.   According to a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with more than 19 million deaths reported every year.   Globally, heart disease-rElated deaths increased from 12,4 million in 1990 to 19,8 million in 2022.   Health experts say the Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East regions are estimated to have the highest burden of deaths due to heart related diseases, with high blood pressure, raised cholesterol, dietary risks and air pollution being the leading causes.

The new ICT system for processing these permits and licenses is fully integrated with the Central Vehicle Registry to validate vehicle licensing and registration details. In a statement yesterday, Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona confirmed the development. “Pursuant to the objectives of National Development Strategy 1 and the utility of digitalization as an enabler of economic development across the broad spectrum of growth factors, including in transportation, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development wishes to advise the public of the launch of the digital Cross Border Permits and COMESA Carrier Licenses for passenger and freight transport operators with effect from Thursday 9 May, 2024. “A digital Cross Border Permit is issued in terms of Article 4 of the Bilateral Road Transport Agreements signed between Zimbabwe and SADC Member States. Similarly, a COMESA Carrier License is issued in terms of Article 85 of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa Treaty. The Bilateral Road Transport Agreements and the COMESA Treaty are meant to facilitate the smooth and unimpeded flow of cross-border traffic between countries,” he said. He said the digital Cross Border Permits and COMESA Carrier Licenses have enhanced security features. “Consequently, as a counterfeit deterrence measure, these permits and licenses have a digitally signed barcode which is readable by any mobile device.

https://www.herald.co.zw/zim-to-become-africas-fertiliser-production-hub/,Zim to become Africa’s fertiliser production hub,"Zvamaida Murwira recently in NAIROBI, Kenya Zimbabwe is set to be an African hub of fertiliser production, research and training after the African Union Summit resolved to rejuvenate and capacitate the African Centre for Fertiliser Development in Harare, President Mnangagwa has said. The centre was set up in Harare by the continental body in the 1980s to boost research, training and production, but has been dormant. It established in Zimbabwe through an AU protocol to train, provide technological transfer, support research and demonstrate the role of fertiliser to improve agriculture and fertiliser management practices. It also seeks to provide support to the fertiliser sector in Africa and coordinate projects at national, regional and international levels in the adaptation, testing and demonstration of improved fertiliser production. President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe stood to benefit immensely from the rejuvenation of the continental centre. He was speaking in an interview with Zimbabwean journalists at the conclusion of the African Fertiliser and Soil Health Summit in Nairobi last week. The summit drew Heads of State and Government from the continent. African leaders resolved to fully use the centre in Zimbabwe to stop dependence on the global North, from where the continent is importing the bulk of its fertiliser, spending billions of US dollars in the process. Said the President: “It has been there. It was an AU decision a long time back. “It has been dormant, in my view, but now the rest of Africa has realised that it is necessary to capacitate it, that is to provide funding from the AU to make sure that it provides services for which it was created and I am happy that we host the continental centre.” President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe, just like other African countries, has been lagging behind in terms of optimum fertiliser use and soil management. “We are behind, as I was listening to what is required, we always thought that application of fertiliser is normal, year after year. It is not like that, the soil itself gets aged, fertiliser cannot continue to be the same, it must continue to be improved, depending on the climate and soil of a particular region. “This is what we are learning and fortunately Zimbabwe is the centre for the continent, as a fertiliser centre, and now we are going to give more focus to make sure we recruit the expertise in that field to ensure that our centre delivers for the purpose of which it was set up.” The President described the summit, which ended last Thursday, as an eye -opener. “This summit brought together Heads of State and Government primarily to deal with the question of agriculture, and, in particular, we now realise that soil requires attention. “We have always thought that soil is soil, But we now realise that it has to be treated like individuals, like persons; this is what the conference was all about, to rejuvenate our soils so that they continue to give us better yields. “Yes, of course, in the past, people in many countries used fertiliser and so on, but it goes beyond just using fertiliser; we are now told that it requires health attention like human beings. “This is an eye opener and fortunately we had our Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Dr Anxious Masuka. I am sure he has benefited from the presentations that were made.” Addressing Heads of State and Government, President Mnangagwa welcomed the decision to revamp the centre, which he described as a critical cog in promoting research on soil health and fertiliser development. “We, thus, welcome the commitment to fully operationalise and support the Africa Centre for Fertiliser Development, which was the brainchild of our august body and whose strategic mandate is aligned with the agenda of this summit,” he said. African Union Commission chairperson Mr Moussa Faki Mahamat said it was sad that the continent continued to import fertiliser, yet it had a centre in Zimbabwe which was not being fully used. “Regarding fertiliser, it constitutes a critical input for productivity if properly used. In terms of fertiliser use, Africa is below the global average, hence the meeting in Abuja which set 50kg per hectare per year. Some African countries produce fertiliser but we depend mostly on imported fertiliser, making it very expensive for our farmers yet the African Centre for Fertiliser Development based in Zimbabwe has been in existence since the 1980s. “We must optimise use of such existing continental assets to boost local fertiliser production and deliver to our farmers at affordable prices,” he said. “This is imperative if we are to improve the continent’s agricultural sector, which is key for our sovereignty and security.” In an interview, Minister Masuka said one of the summit’s resolutions was a declaration to integrate the centre, which is a fertiliser coordination mechanism platform, to become one of the AU organs. “You remember in 1981 (the then) Organisation of African Unity established a fertiliser coordination mechanism at continental level, the Africa Centre for Fertiliser Development, which Zimbabwe proudly hosted. “Eight countries have ratified, 33 countries have signed for it but it is not functioning as a continental institution and one of the declarations coming out of this conference is the full integration of this Pan-African institution into the main AU body, so that it can deliver the necessary research and development, also the capacitation that is required to ensure sustainable increase in the use of organic and inorganic fertiliser and the use of soil health,” said Minister Masuka. The summit, which ran under the theme “Listen to the Land”, had outcomes that include a 10-year action plan to deliver concrete action for steps to be taken by African leaders and stakeholders. The action plan will focus on new policies and investments that will enable farmers to work towards re-building soil health and ultimately increase yield responses and profitability. The summit came after the first held in 2006 in Abuja, Nigeria, which endorsed the Abuja Declaration on Fertiliser for the Africa Green Revolution, a continental strategy to reverse the trend of poor productivity of African soils.

As the Government continues to make strides in making civic documents readily available and easy to access, the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry has completed the setting up of the e-passport processing centre in Johannesburg. Plans are afoot to open five more e-passport offices abroad, including in the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and the US. The Second Republic is walking the talk on bringing services closer to the people, locally and abroad. In an interview, Permanent Secretary for Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, Ambassador Raphael Faranisi, said all was in place to start the issue of e-passports in South Africa from this week. “Staff from the registrar’s office will this week be travelling to our South African Embassy to train the consulate staff on how to process e-passports. “The Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry was doing renovations at the consulate, but it is now complete. So, this week, while training the consulate staff, they will also be issuing the e-passports.” Within two weeks, issuing e-passports would be in full swing. Ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage will officially commission the office on a date to be announced. The Government has opened several e-passport centres countrywide including in Guruve, Gwanda, Gweru, Lupane, Marondera, Beitbridge, Chitungwiza, Hwange, Mazowe, Murehwa, Zvishavane, Chinhoyi and Guruve, to add to the facilities at Chiwashira Muchecheterwa Building in Harare and at provincial and district offices in Bulawayo. Issuance of e-passports began on January 18 2022, as the civil registry department took heed of the Government’s directive to smoothen the process of acquiring travel documents, which, until then, was a nightmare for many people. The launch of the e-passport and the state-of-the-art passport enrolment centre, is in line with the Government’s vision of a modern and digitised economy. Strategic investment in key areas of the digital economy is seen as a critical way for Zimbabwe to keep pace with the dynamic and technological environment. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/vp-chiwenga-mourns-farmer-swanepoel/,VP Chiwenga mourns farmer Swanepoel,"Fidelis Munyoro Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga has sent a message of condolence to the Swanepoel family following the passing on of veteran farmer, Mr Nick Swanepoel, who died in South Africa last week. Last  night, VP Chiwenga said he, together with his wife Colonel Miniyothabo Chiwenga and staff from his office join President Mnangagwa in mourning Mr Swanepoel. He described Mr Swanepoel as a farmer of repute and a fine gentleman who served Mashonaland West Province and the nation at large with distinction. “He belonged to a rare breed of former farm owners who took it upon themselves to selflessly negotiate with the Government, culminating in the signing of the Global Compensation Deed, which provided a lasting solution to the land question in Zimbabwe,” he said. Mr Nick Swanepoel worked well with  VP Chiwenga in the Joint Resources Mobilisation Committee and his contribution to this noble national cause will solely be missed. “We shall forever cherish the moments we spent with him and remain indebted to him for his selfless contribution to the development of our great nation. To the Swanepoel family, please accept our heartfelt condolences.” Mr Swanepoel played a key and progressive role in the search for a cordial, negotiated settlement to the Zimbabwean land question, according to President Mnangagwa in his condolence message last Friday. President Mnangagwa extolled Mr Swanepoel’s level-headedness and the role he played when Zimbabwe corrected the skewed land distribution, which favoured white settlers to the detriment of native Zimbabweans. Mr Swanepoel was a long-time leader of the Commercial Farmers Union from the year 2000 when the struggle for the recovery of land entered a decisive phase. He and like-minded progressive white farmers kept their heads and tirelessly pushed for a non-confrontational and non-political approach to the land question, even calling for the removal of the then right-wing CFU executive led by Mr Tim Henwood, which they correctly saw as an obstacle to a just resolution of the land question. President Mnangagwa implored the nation to recommit to the vision of a non-racial society as the country mourns and remembers Mr Swanepoel, a great figure of post-independence racial conciliation through just settlement. All Zimbabweans, he added, should deepen and entrench the vision for a just, non-racial society in which colour, creed or tribe never count or matter in daily lives and engagements. After a successful land reform, the Government under the leadership of President Mnangagwa, signed the agreement that committed to compensate white ex-farmers up to US$3,5 billion for land developments.

Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Deputy Minister, Mr David Mnangagwa, told Parliament last week that Government was working closely with the private sector to facilitate small transactions, allowing citizens to access foreign currency legally and conveniently. This follows the suspension of more than 4 000 EcoCash agents in 2020 on allegations of participating in the then rampant trend of charging excessive premiums for customers intending to cash in their mobile money. He announced the change in policy in the Senate last week while responding to Senators’ queries on measures taken by the Government to address illegal foreign currency trading. “We are working on a solution as Government, coupled with the private sector, to allow for small transactions, that is the general populace to be able to get the small amounts, $20 or $50, through negotiations with our mobile network operators to be able to access the bureaux de change that are on their EcoCash or Netcash platforms. “This means if you have an Econet line and if you register for EcoCash, you can convert from ZiG to US dollars, or from US dollars to ZiG at the official exchange rate. That is the first part to allow interchangeability without having to go to the streets,” the Deputy Minister said. This move is expected to promote financial inclusion, reduce reliance on the black market for the small transactions and increase the use of electronic ZiG. The plan, the Deputy Minister said, also involved reactivating EcoCash agents across the country, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that everyone had access to legal foreign currency. “The second part is, we are still in discussion. Right now, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is talking to the mobile network operators, mentioning Econet in particular because they were suspended in 2020 after some issues that now have been ironed   out. “We would want to have agents reactivated so that the most remote areas, our constituents, the citizenry can access both US dollars and ZiG from their wallets. “Econet went a step further last week and zero-rated the charges for sending money from parts of the diaspora to Zimbabwe. This was a show of good faith and support for Government during this El Nino period as well as to show the commitment in bolstering our efforts in supporting and defending.” "

Amai Mnangagwa’s long-term commitment, as the country’s health and child care ambassador, to improve access to quality health care by vulnerable groups through technology and enhancing women economic empowerment saw her facilitate the establishment of a community e-commerce and e-health centre at Maria Theresa Clinic. A clinic which she built using her personal resources and named it after her late mother. The e-health initiative at Maria Theresa now enables community members to go through virtual medical consultations, receive accurate diagnoses and get prescriptions without the need to travel long distances. The First Lady also donated a vehicle and electric bicycle cart to Maria Theresa and Rosa hospital also received an electric bicycle cart courtesy of the Angel of Hope Foundation and its partners which will be used to pay home visits and deliver medicine to the elderly and patients in hard to reach area. Amai Mnangagwa also handed over two top notch vehicles donated by President Mnangagwa to Kakora Primary and Secondary Schools where she received her education. The First Lady is motivated by her desire to meet the needs of less privileged people and she has continued advocating for their upliftment as she was raised in a similar background. Her wish and passion stems from the way she grew up in a child-headed family, with her being the second child. Amai Mnangagwa’s dreams are to see a better life for the vulnerable groups and less-privileged communities. True to the name of her organisation, the First Lady has been an angel of hope who is devoting time and resources to ensure those in marginalised communities are not forgotten.  Former legislators Dr Sekai Nzenza (left), Cde Joseph Chinotimba and Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe chairperson Dr Tafadzwa Musarara follow proceedings during the launch of the e-health and e-commerce centres in Mashonaland Central province Through the newly launched e-health facility, a patient in Chiweshe had a medical consultation with a doctor in Mutare and received treatment virtually courtesy of the tele-medicine facility, which connects a patient with any doctor worldwide. In her address, the First Lady went down memory lane, narrating her upbringing while taking time to appreciate the community that raised. All she could say was, “Thank you”, as the villagers cheered, ululated and whistled. Amai Mnangagwa said Kakora village played a crucial role in her upbringing and moulding her into the person she is today along with her siblings among them Chief Negomo. “I was born at Rossa Hospital. I went to Kakora Primary School wearing slip-ons. Life was difficult after both parents passed on,” she said. “The community assisted us to be where we are today. For me to learn how to read and write it started at Kakora Primary School.” Amai Mnangagwa said the donated vehicles were a gift from President Mnangagwa, a token of appreciation to the Kakora village. There were exhibition stands which were mounted among them one from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The First Lady encouraged Zimbabweans to embrace and protect the new currency. “Let us protect our money, our economy is on the rebound. Gold doesn’t turn rusty it remains gold so our currency must be the same,” she said.  TV personality Oscar Pambuka who was rehabilitated from drug and substance abuse gives his testimony on the dangers after an invitation by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa during an interactive session with the youths at Kakora village in Chiweshe A former drug and substance victim, and television personality Oscar Pambuka, was invited by Amai Mnangagwa to give inspirational message against drug and substance abuse. He thanked the First Lady for giving him another chance to be a better person. Pambuka said he joined the national broadcaster, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, in 2000 and in 2016, he started using crystal meth until his arrest last year. “From wearing suits and reading the news to drug addiction, my incarceration became my turning point. Parents, when you see your children isolating themselves be inquisitive, drug abuse is real,” he said. “I thank the First Lady for listening to my plight and speaking passionately against drug and substance abuse. Your voice is powerful when it comes to drug and substance abuse, Amai. Tinokutendai sevana venyu,” he said. Kakora Primary School head Ms Tendayi Mushore said she was overjoyed, expressing her heartfelt gratitude to President Mnangagwa and the First Lady for always remembering them. “We previously faced transport challenges, but with this generous gift, we will now be able to travel effortlessly, conducting school business and transporting children to sports competitions without the need to hire a car. This vehicle will be a valuable asset for our school. “At the same time, I would like to extend our deepest appreciation to His Excellency, President Mnangagwa, for supporting Amai to remember us. “Our First Lady has always been a big pillar of strength for our school, and today we are proud to boast a world-class computer lab, equipped with 42 laptops, a projector, and a whiteboard, making our children’s education a seamless experience,” she said.  Vehicles that were donated by President Mnangagwa to Kakora Primary and Secondary schools, former schools of First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa Kakora Primary School Development Committee chairperson Ms Eunice Mhondiwa said Amai Mnangagwa was a fountain of humility, love and kindness. “We are thrilled to receive these cars. It is always a pleasure to receive support from the President and our mother. We promise to use the vehicles wisely and handle them with care, as they are vital tools for our schools.” Ms Mhondiwa said this was not the first time the President and Amai had supported them, and appreciate their continued kindness. “We are also excited that our children are attending a school that our First Lady attended, and we hope they will grow up to become accomplished individuals just like her. “We are delighted that she always remembers her roots and continues to support our community,” she said. Mrs Nelia Shumba nee-Negomo also showered the First Lady with praises. “We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the First Lady for her tireless charity work. She founded the Angel of Hope Foundation, which cares for the vulnerable groups and we are extremely proud of her selfless efforts. We take great pride in her compassion and generosity. “We pray to God to grant her many more years of life, so she can continue her remarkable charity work. Her kindness extends far beyond her home village, as she supports numerous people across the country,” she said.  Some of the traditional foods which were showcased during the launch of community e-health and e-commerce centres by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa at Kakora village Mrs Shumba said the tele-health facility was a game changer. “With the clinic she also built in this area, we have been introduced to tele-health. We can now consult with doctors from China, the UK, or any other country through video calls. The modern technology that our First Lady has brought to our community is truly remarkable, and we would like to express our gratitude for her wonderful contributions,” she said. Kakora Secondary School acting headmaster Mr Samuel Mangwiro also appreciated the kind gesture from the President and the First Lady. “Previously, we received a donation of 40 computers and she also drilled a borehole for us. Today, she has surprised us with a vehicle donation, and we would like to express our heartfelt appreciation for her generosity. “We are grateful that she has not forgotten her roots, the place where she was educated, and the community that groomed her,” he said. Kakora Secondary School Development Association chairperson Brian Mweda said whenever Amai Mnangagwa sets her foot in the area, it brings smiles to the villagers. “It is a momentous occasion, and I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our President and Amai who have made this day a reality. Kakora Secondary School has faced numerous challenges, including delays in receiving Zimsec exam papers and transporting them. “However, with this generous gift, those logistical challenges will become a thing of the past. We will jealously guard this gift to ensure it serves the intended purpose and has a lasting impact on our school community,” he said.

https://www.herald.co.zw/bill-seeks-more-protection-for-depositors/,Bill seeks more protection for depositors,"Farirai Machivenyika and 
Gloria Muruva The proposed amendments to the Deposit Protection Corporation Act will prioritise the compensation of ordinary depositors over institutional debtors in the event of bank failures, acting Deposit Protection Corporation chief executive, Ms Kiitumetsi Zawanda told Parliamentarians last week. Speaking at a breakfast meeting with legislators from the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion last Friday she updated them on the amendments to the Deposit Protection Corporation Act. The Deposit Protection Corporation was established in 2003 to compensate depositors from losses incurred in the event of bank failures. “The current Act ranks depositors who are the unsophisticated people from the constituencies and so forth not as high as we would want them to be. You find that statutory creditors like Zimra, Zimdef and NSSA were ranked higher in terms of creditors of the bank than (ordinary) depositors. “So, we thought to fix that because Zimra does have powers to pursue the bank, while it’s still alive so why should we be giving them preference at that stage when we can protect the unsophisticated and innocent depositor instead,” she said. Ms Zawanda said the proposed amendments would also ensure that shareholders of formerly insolvent institutions do not benefit from any currency changes or inflation that may result in them becoming solvent. “You find that some liabilities, five to 10 years ago were in US dollars and some changes happened in the economy and that liability became Zimbabwe dollar. “This change of value gave an advantage to some of the shareholders because there comes a point where there is a residue because of a movement of inflation and they gain because of those movements. “We found ourselves with residue and the law currently states that residue has to be returned to shareholders so these are some of the things we are trying to address in the current amendments so that what was once an insolvent institution does not fortuitously become solvent because of operation of economic fundamentals,” she added. Deposit Protection Corporation chairman, Mr Agmos Moyo said the Act was important in protecting depositors. “The Depositors Protection Corporation Act plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the interests of depositors and maintaining confidence in our banking institutions. “The Deposit Protection Corporation’s job is to be a soft landing for the depositors in the event of a bank failure. By providing a safety net for depositors in the event of a bank failure, this legislation is essential for promoting financial stability and protecting the savings of individuals and businesses across Zimbabwe,” he said. The chairman of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance and Economic Development and Investment Promotion Cde Clemence Chiduwa said amendments to the Act were essential in protecting the depositors and maintaining trust in the banking and financial services sector. “One of the primary reasons why amending the deposit protection laws is crucial is to safeguard depositors’ funds. In the event of a bank failure or financial crisis, depositors should have confidence that their money is safe and will be reimbursed up to a certain limit. “By enhancing deposit protection laws, we can instil trust in the banking system and encourage more people to save and invest their money, ultimately promoting economic growth and stability,” he said. Cde Chiduwa said maintaining a robust deposit protection framework was essential for maintaining financial stability within the country, in times of economic uncertainty or banking crises. A lack of adequate deposit insurance could lead to widespread panic withdrawals, bank runs and systemic risks. Other proposed amendments to the law include enhanced use of ICTs in deposit protection to cut out travel by ordinary people to prove their claims, representation of depositors on the Depositors Protection Corporation board and protection of assets of failed institutions from theft by unscrupulous shareholders among others. The country experienced at least nine bank failures in the 2000s as many of the newly licenced banks ran into major trouble, often with executives and shareholders becoming major borrowers. The new banks run properly not only survived the turmoil, but in some cases have become leaders of the sector. "

Zimbabwe Sugar Association Experiment Station senior agriculture and industrial research chemist Dr Washington Mutatu said the public must not panic over any temporary shortage since there was enough sugar cane ready for harvest. “I think currently we are producing enough sugar cane to produce sugar which should be able to supply our domestic market and for export. So consumers should not be worried about the availability of sugar, it’s actually available,” he said. Exports were not going to be stripping the local market since Zimbabwean sugar was uncompetitive because of the high production costs of electricity, water, fertiliser and labour. “Our cost of production is very high, so as scientists we have to investigate ways and methods of reducing the cost of production,” said Dr Mutatu. He wanted to see sugar producers diversity into manufacture of more sugar by-products to improve their revenue streams. Some of the by-products of sugar are ethanol, fuels and molasses. – Ziana. "

This forecast reflects improvements in the services and trade sectors. However, the IMF noted that the growth outlook remains challenging for Africa’s most populous nation and leading oil producer. In March, food price inflation reached 40 percent, prompting concerns about food security. According to the IMF mission chief for Nigeria, Axel Schimmelpfenning “If Nigeria grows at 3,3 percent that is just above the population dynamics, which is a big challenge.” The Fund projected that fuel subsidies could be up to 3 percent of GDP this year due to the disparity between pump prices and their dollar cost, according to Schimmelpfennig.  He further stated that officials are dedicated to gradually phasing out these subsidies within the next one or two years. “The reforms are focused on how to raise that growth so that Nigerians can see real impacts on their living standards,” Schimmelpfenning said. “We think a lot has happened. We also have to recognise that the problems built up over many years were quite severe. We can’t expect that everything is going to be resolved overnight,” he added. Global rating agencies have upgraded Nigeria’s economic outlook as a result of reform efforts. Fitch, the latest agency to do so, has revised Nigeria’s outlook from stable to positive. Schimmelpfenning noted that scaling up a cash transfer program and increasing government revenues to enhance service provision to citizens are key priorities In terms of monetary policy, the IMF commended the recent interest rate hikes by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to address rising inflation, calling for a data-driven approach for further rate adjustments.– Business Insider Africa

Based on the feedback from market participants, liquidity in Kenyan foreign exchange markets and the ability of foreign investors to repatriate capital from the Kenyan equity market has improved,” the MSCI said on Tuesday. The New York-headquartered firm is the proprietor of the MSCI Kenya index measuring the performance of the large and mid-cap segments of the Kenya market in US dollar terms and has three constituents, namely Safaricom, Equity Group and East African Breweries Plc (EABL). In August 2022, MSCI paused the review of the local index, highlighting market accessibility regarding hard currency availability. Other markets that were handed similar cautions were Nigeria and Sri Lanka. MSCI has also ended its forex concerns in Egypt. According to analysts, the end of the special treatment is set to provide tailwinds for foreign investor participation, particularly those investing in Kenya using information from the index. “The review is positive for Kenyan equities and it might help raise the participation of foreign investors.

https://www.herald.co.zw/bad-weather-war-strain-the-worlds-wheat-supply/,"Bad weather, war strain the world’s wheat supply","Bad weather and war are threatening to keep the world’s wheat supplies under strain and reviving the specter of rising food costs. From soggy fields in western Europe to parched soil in Australia and the war in Ukraine holding back supplies, farmers face setbacks.  That means global stockpiles will remain the smallest in almost a decade, according to analysts surveyed ahead of the US government’s first forecast for next season. Bumper Black Sea harvests have long kept a lid on prices and wheat is trading at half its record set in 2022, but supply concerns are mounting again. Futures have rebounded to hit the highest since August and funds are trimming bearish bets that they’ve held for almost two years. That’s a worrying sign for consumers who’ve finally found relief from rising food prices. Any prolonged rally could increase costs for bread and pasta and rekindle inflationary pressure on central banks — with other major crops like cocoa and coffee also climbing this year. “Demand has increased, stocks remain tight globally and new crop issues are escalating,” said James Bolesworth, managing director at CRM AgriCommodities. With Northern Hemisphere harvests approaching, the next few weeks remain critical for crop development, so there’s still time for things to improve — or worsen. Here’s a roundup of conditions in major growers: Top exporter, Russia risks missing out on crucial moisture, with weeks of heat and not enough rain in the country’s south prompting analysts to cut harvest estimates. Half Russia’s winter wheat will remain too dry over the next two weeks, Commodity Weather Group said Wednesday. Russia should still reap a big crop, but its dominance means that any jolts to local prices feed through to other markets — and the country’s wheat has been getting more expensive lately. -Bloomberg

https://www.herald.co.zw/zimre-strategy-still-anchored-on-creating-strong-cash-wallet/,‘Zimre strategy still anchored on creating strong cash wallet’,"Nelson Gahadza Senior Business Reporter Zimre Holdings (ZHL) says its strategy remains anchored on delivering a strong cash wallet by driving a cost-effective insurance float and increasing the contribution from regional investments. ZHL is a diversified investment holding company with core competencies in insurance and property. The company has investments in Zimbabwe and the Southern African region. Mr Stanley Kudenga, ZHL group chief executive officer, told analysts last week that the group would increase the contribution from its regional investments by upscaling their balance sheets and effective deployment of competitive capital across all strategic business units. He said the group would also tilt its property portfolio towards high yielding commercial and retail sectors through near liquid investment structures. “We had an independent actuarial assessment of the depth of the markets that we operate in and the level of competitive capital that would be required and they came up with a figure of US$12 million. “Out of that US$12 million, we have already internally deployed about US$7 million and the remaining US$5 million will need to go into Malawi and Zambia,” he said. In Zambia, Mr Kudenga said there was now a requirement for foreign companies to have local participation at the shareholding level of least 25 percent. As a result, Mr Kudenga said ZHL was looking at doing some kind of a rights issue where it would then cede its rights to selected investors in the local market, which means that there was capital in the local market. “Malawi is almost the same thing but by and large we are also looking at complementing it from capital from the local market,” he said. Mr Kudenga said the group’s cash generated from operations for the year to December 31, 2023 increased to US$13,67 million from US$8,9 million in 2022 in line with the group’s cash wallet model. During the period under review, 84 percent of the group’s revenue was US dollar revenue and all business units generated positive cash flows. ZHL chief finance officer Mr Zvenyika Zvenyika said insurance contract revenue increased by 7 percent to US$62,68 million in 2023 compared to US$58,58 million in 2022. He said the strong top line growth was underpinned by local reinsurance and pensions business operations. The local reinsurance cash contribution was US$1,796 million, Life and pensions US$4,943 million, reinsurance foreign US$3,542 million and property US$2,203 million. “Healthy total income surge was driven by expansion into new markets, introduction of innovative product offerings, new business acquisitions, increased business support, and positive investment income returns,” said Mr Zvenyika. He noted that total expenses were kept under check following the strategic underwriting decision to reduce participation in loss making portfolios and a decline in climate change induced cyclone related claims. Mr Chakanyuka Nziradzemhuka, the chief operating officer said the group completed the balance sheet reorganization of Emeritus International Re in Botswana which serves as the backbone of ZHL’s Great Africa Trek. He said the group was exploring new opportunities in Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda. “The group successfully enhanced the Emeritus Re Mozambique balance sheet with a US$2 million capital raise that increased underwriting capacity,” said Mr Nziradzemhuka. As the group’s property portfolio tilted towards high yielding commercial and retail sectors through near liquid investment structures, its Eagle Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) attained Prescribed Asset Status from the Insurance and Pensions Commission of Zimbabwe (IPEC) post the reporting period. Mr Nziradzemhuka said it is anticipated that the Eagle REIT will bring much needed liquidity to the real estate market especially for Zimbabwe’s pensions community. “The Eagle REIT project has been ably supported with one project already underway in Mazowe which is at 13 percent completion. “In Victoria Falls we successfully acquired land and title and the group further extended commitment to the town by securing a refuse truck propelling high standards,” he said. He added that the group will continue to consolidate on its experience and dynamism to enhance market share acquisition through innovations and new tools that embrace customer centric ecosystems which will create new value and change for its stakeholders. During the year under review, the group’s profit increased by 321 percent from $72,4 billion to $304,9 billion in inflation adjusted terms and a 767 percent growth under historical cost terms, soaring to $528,1 billion. The group’s total assets uplifted by 81 percent to $1,180,2 billion from $650,5 billion in inflation adjusted terms and in historical cost total assets grew by 769 percent to $1,151,6 billion from $132,5 billion buoyed by growth in investment properties and equity investments which constituted 70 percent of total assets.

https://www.herald.co.zw/govt-targets-350-000ha-under-irrigation-by-2025/,Govt targets 350 000ha under irrigation by 2025,"Business Reporter THE Government is targeting to increase irrigable land from 217 000 hectares to 350 000 ha by 2025 to accelerate its climate-proof agriculture programmes. In the latest Second Round of Crops, Livestock and Fisheries Assessment report released by the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, last week the Southern African indicated it was underutilising its dams and irrigable land. “With over 10 600 dams capable of irrigating 2 million hectares, and with only just 217 000 hectares functional irrigation in 2024, Zimbabwe has under-invested in this vital enabler and has suffered the consequences through threats to food security,” the report reads. According to the ministry, the targeted 350 000 ha under irrigation by 2025 cannot be achieved with a business-as-usual approach amid calls for radical innovative financing mechanisms, given most of the proportion of the irrigation development has been funded by the Government. This comes after the Government achieved 846 hectares of additional irrigation while the private sector and individuals put a combined 3 325 ha under irrigation. Development partners chipped in with 1 255 ha, bringing the cumulative additional land under irrigation for the 2023/24 season to 5 426ha. This shows that the Irrigation Development Alliance, a Government-initiated, private-sector-led collaboration for exploitation of innovating financing arrangements to unlock resources to develop 120 000ha irrigation facilities in the next two years has begun to bear fruit. According to the ministry, farmers need a reprieve on utility rates and tariffs as an incentive for investing in such critical infrastructure. “Once available, irrigation must be complemented by affordable water charges. Government is gazetting the 31 percent tariff reduction, and streamlining both the ZINWA (Zimbabwe National Water Authority) and Water Acts to reduce bureaucratic sloth, and entrench efficiency,” the report said. Agriculture analyst Mr Vimbai Magura believes lower rates will free funds for farmers to invest in their operations. “Incentives for irrigation-based agriculture are crucial for sustainable farming practices. Lower rates and tariffs provide much-needed relief for farmers investing in irrigation infrastructure. It not only encourages adoption but also fosters long-term viability in agriculture,” he said. Another analyst Ms Sheila Anderson said the planned move was commendable but there would be need for farmers to save water for longer use. “As an agriculture analyst, I emphasise the importance of affordable water charges to support irrigation ventures. The government’s planned move to reduce tariffs by 31 percent is commendable and aligns with the goal of streamlining bureaucratic processes.  Efficient water management is fundamental for boosting agricultural productivity and ensuring food security,” she added. Such initiatives become critical as Zimbabwe is predicted to become drier in the decades ahead, with increased frequency to extreme weather events, so climate-proofing agriculture through accelerated irrigation development must be pursued with the energy and urgency that it deserves.

https://www.herald.co.zw/how-business-has-helped-pull-sa-back-from-the-brink/,How business has helped pull SA back from the brink,"South Africa has gone 43 days without load shedding and Transnet’s rail and port performance is on the mend. All going well, load shedding may be history by the end of 2025. That’s largely the result of the collaboration between business and government, known as the Joint Steering Oversight Committee (JSOC), which was launched 11 months ago to pull SA back from the brink of economic implosion. It was launched under the president’s office at a time when load shedding was a daily occurrence and Transnet’s rail performance had regressed to post-World War 2 levels. A JSOC update last week put some flesh on the skeleton of an initiative that many at the time dismissed as another forum for talk and not much else. More than 150 CEOs from the private sector have signed up for the initiative, which is focused around three key areas deemed most urgent: energy, transport and logistics, and crime and corruption. Some 350 specialists have been deployed to power stations, Transnet and various crime initiatives, racking up close to 7 000 hours of contribution. Here are some of the milestones: Energy Load shedding is down 61 percent for the period December 2023 to February 2024 compared to the same period the prior year; Stage 4 load shedding is down 80 percent; Six gigawatts (GW) of new generation capacity has been added to the grid; The investment pipeline for new power generation has doubled; Requests for proposals (RFPs) have been issued for 7.6GW of renewable energy, gas-to-power and battery storage; New CEO for Eskom appointed (Dan Marokane); The National Transmission Company of South Africa (NTCSA) has been established, and a board put in place to unbundle and separately manage Eskom’s transmission grid; and Eskom’s energy available factor has improved above 55 percent. Transport and logistics New CEOs appointed at Transnet (Michelle Phillips) and Transnet Freight Rail (Russell Baatjies); 36 percent less waiting time to anchor vessels (as at March 2024); 45 percent fewer vessels anchored outside Durban; National Treasury agreed to a R47 billion guarantee for Transnet, subject to conditions; R700 million investment in key rail corridors, much of it for security (with the private sector providing drones and other security support to combat cable and equipment theft); Transnet’s draft ‘Network Statement’ has been published as the first step to attracting private investment and readying the rail provider for competition before the end of 2024; and The decline in freight volumes was arrested in 2024 and volumes for the 2024/5 year are targeted for 193 million tonnes , just short of the 200-220 million tonnes needed to support economic recovery.  – Moneyweb Crime and corruption Twenty high priority and complex cases identified for prosecution with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) as part of a strategy to remove SA from the Financial Action Task Force grey list; Crime call centre modernised; NPA Amendment Bill tabled to establish the Investigating Directorate against Corruption and provide for the appointment of anti-corruption investigators; Exodus of skills from the NPA has been arrested and it is being re-staffed; Plans in place to leverage R56 million investment by the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric) and Banking Association of SA (Basa) for the creation of a forensic analysis centre and training for complex cases; and -A key target is the reduction of infrastructure crime at Eskom and Transnet, and there is evidence that this is happening. ‘Quick results’ Speaking at a PSG investor conference on Thursday, Transnet chair Andile Sangqu said the willingness of business to assist in turning around performance at the ports and rail operator has delivered some quick results. One of these was the supply of drones and 24-hour security on key corridors to combat cable theft, which has been crippling operations. Another was the loan of seven cranes by international shipping companies, which were delivered and deployed to Cape Town to ease port congestion around the festive season. Earlier in the day, Rudi Dicks, head of project management in the Office of The Presidency, pointed to some encouraging investments in the renewable energy space, with a decline in unplanned outages, aided by 4 000MW of new power coming on stream in 2024 and an expected 7 000MW in 2025. James MacKay, CEO of the Energy Council of SA, said ending load shedding is the first target in a much larger campaign towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a tough target that is likely to be missed. This is the same target being pursued by the UK, which has a 15-year head start on SA. The proliferation of rooftop solar systems is an important part of easing the energy crisis, and now the focus is on large corporate buyers and developers building wind and solar systems at utility-level scale. The business partnership with the government has had a significant impact on addressing the energy crisis by building strong governance structures and good working relations through the National Energy A total of R1,5 trillion is needed over 10 years to sustain the energy transition, equivalent to R1,5 billion a year. That requires unbundling Eskom, and setting up a new company to manage power transmission. “We need to get our focus out of energy scarcity and load shedding [and on] to the bigger picture,” said MacKay. Jannie Durand, CEO of Remgro and head of the Joint Initiative to Fight Crime and Corruption (JICC), said crime reduces GDP by an estimated 5%, with knock-on impacts on tax collection and the cash economy. “People must believe in the rule of law. That creates confidence for long term investment,” said Durand. He added that the purpose of the initiative is to create jobs and revive the economy. JSOC is vital to making SA attractive for investment and creating jobs. “If we can get regulatory structure in place, and we minimise [the] trust deficit, there are huge opportunities [in SA]. Look at how many installers have found employment in solar.” Moneyweb "
https://www.herald.co.zw/trading-in-bindura-shares-halted-on-vfex/,Trading in Bindura shares halted on VFEX,"Enacy Mapakame TRADING in the shares of nickel producer, Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC) has been halted on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) after its major asset, Trojan Mine, was placed under reconstruction. This also comes as the resources group has been facing operational challenges amid subdued global nickel prices, which have dropped about 25 percent year on year. Although the reconstruction order was issued against Trojan Mine alone, which is the country’s primary nickel producer, this would have an impact on the entire group, resulting in its suspension, which is the first suspension at the US dollar-denominated exchange. “The Victoria Falls Stock Exchange Limited (VFEX) hereby notifies the investing public of the voluntary suspension from trading in shares of Bindura Nickel Corporation Limited (BNC or the Company) with effect from 06 May 2024 following the placement of its major operating subsidiary, Trojan Nickel Mine Limited, under a Reconstruction Order in terms of the Reconstruction of State-Indebted Insolvent Companies Act (Cap 24:27) (Reconstruction Act),” said head of VFEX markets Mr Robert Mubaiwa in a notice to stakeholders. According to the VFEX, the suspension is for the duration of the administration period, which was announced last week in the Government Gazette. “The Reconstruction Act has among other provisions, the following clause: “6 (d) every disposition of the property, including rights of action, of the company and every transfer of shares or alteration in the status of its members, made after the commencement of the reconstruction, shall, unless the administrator otherwise orders, be void” Although the Reconstruction Order was issued against Trojan Nickel Mine Limited, BNC as the holding company is equally affected with the order pursuant to Section 4 (3) (a) of the Reconstruction Act. “As a result, the administrator has applied for the voluntary suspension in trading of BNC shares on the VFEX,” explained Mr Mubaiwa. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe (SecZim) approved the suspension of the resources group which migrated from the primary bourse Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) in 2021. Earlier, the group cautioned that ongoing low nickel prices, high input costs—particularly electrical expenses—substantial mining depth, and low resource grade persist in negatively impacting its operations. The group highlighted that despite the completion of the Sub-Vertical Rock (SVR) Project, which caused a temporary shutdown of BNC’s Trojan Nickel Mine (TNM) from September 22, 2023, the company continues to encounter various challenges that are expected to cause delays in the resumption of mining activities at Trojan. In a trading update for the nine months to December 31, 2023, the resources group reported tonnes of ore mined at 177 179, decreased by 37 percent in comparison to 281 560 tonnes achieved for the same period last year. In line with the decrease in the tonnes of ore mined, the tonnes of ore milled at 163 674, decreased by 42 percent from 281 135 tonnes recorded in a similar period last year.  Nickel in concentrates produced, at 1 314 tonnes, was 40 percent lower than the 2 192 tonnes recorded for the same period last year due to lower milled tonnage and grade of mined ore.

https://www.herald.co.zw/african-sun-recovers-betters-pre-covid-era/,"African Sun recovers, betters pre-Covid era","Enacy Mapakame Listed hospitality group, African Sun Limited is progressing well in its recovery journey with the group surpassing pre-Covid 19 occupancy levels across its operations during the year to December 31, 2023. According to the group, hotel occupancies increased to 52 percent, which was 6 percentage points above 2022. The improved occupancy paid dividends during the year under review, with the group recording a revenue growth of 30 percent to US$54,73 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The improved performance was driven by firmer Average Daily Rates (ADR), which closed the year at US$110, representing an increase of 39 percent against US$79 achieved during the comparable period as a result of changes in customer mix. Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) increased by 58 percent to US$57, up from US$36 in the comparative period. However, further growth was counterbalanced by an increase in operating expenses stemming from exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures, tempering the overall financial performance. African Sun’s operating expenses, excluding depreciation, increased by 43 percent to US$27,63 million compared to US$19,29 million in 2022 driven largely by exchange rate volatility, inflationary pressures, and the crystallisation of expenses in US dollar as the economy continued to dollarise at a rapid pace. Management at the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) listed firm indicated that the troup will continue to monitor costs and implement various cost-saving initiatives. During the year under review, the group posted an operating profit of US$3,74 million.African Sun, however, recorded a marginal profit after tax from continuing operations of US$0,52 million, largely as a result of the harsh macroeconomic operating environment, characterised by costs escalating at a higher rate than revenues, compounded by material exchange rate losses triggered by the above mentioned rebasing of the group’s functional currency, as highlighted below. The group had a high effective tax rate for the year under review, worsened by declining values of capital allowances due to inflation. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) was US$9,45 million, a decrease from US$17,86 million in 2022, and the loss for the period was US$0,36 million. Two of the group’s hotels under external leases had their base rentals changed from local currency to US dollar, and this had the downstream effect of significantly increasing the lease liability interest and right-of-use assets depreciation compared to 2022. The discontinued operations loss of US$0,89 million largely comprises property and equipment impairments post the closure of The Kingdom at Victoria Falls Hotel and the Makasa Sun Casino. This follows the mutual termination of the lease at The Kingdom at Victoria Falls Hotel, due to an untenable lease tenure. The group will continue looking for suitable expansion opportunities in appropriate locations and with the right timing and funding structures. While the business environment may remain uncertain due to the adverse impacts of the El Nino induced drought on agriculture, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) projections of improved arrivals are encouraging for the hospitality group and the tourism industry in general. The UNWTO projects international tourist arrivals to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, with initial estimates pointing to a 2 percent growth above the 2019 levels, underpinned by increased air connectivity, and continued recovery of Asian markets and destinations. On the domestic front, African Sun anticipates yield on the growing demand for Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing, and Events (MICE) business as well as benefits from several high-profile events, including the just ended Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) and the Victoria Falls Carnival, an event  they are hosting at Elephant Hills Resort and Conference Centre, among others.

https://www.herald.co.zw/fbc-re-bounces-back-to-profitability/,FBC Re bounces back to profitability,"Enacy Mapakame FBC Reinsurance (FBC Re) bounced back to profitability in the year to December 31, 2023, from a $2,6 billion loss recorded during the prior year comparative period. According to the financial services group, the unit achieved a profit before tax of $7,3 billion, supported mainly by investment income. To enhance its product portfolio and consolidate its market share, FBC Reinsurance is developing new products focusing on agriculture, health, and funeral business. “The introduction of these new product segments is aimed at increasing the company’s underwriting capacity and improving the quality of earnings,” said FBC Holdings Group chief executive officer Mr Trynos Kufazvinei in a performance update for the period under review. Additionally, FBC Reinsurance is a signatory to the Nairobi Declaration on Sustainable Insurance, which is supported by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). The declaration encourages insurance practitioners in Africa to collaborate in the implementation of sustainable insurance solutions. Leveraging its geographical footprint in Botswana, FBC Reinsurance aims to explore opportunities to collaborate in the deployment of sustainable insurance risk solutions. Meanwhile, the reinsurance business’ sister company, FBC Insurance reported a $3,8 billion profit before tax jumped 65 percent to $3,79 billion from last year’s $2,3 billion. Mr Kufazvinei highlighted that the gap between the premiums collected and claims paid has been widening due to the foreign exchange rate differentials in the economy.  During the period under review, the economy faced a myriad of challenges. Zimbabwe has faced increased global turmoil over the years, notwithstanding an expansionary monetary policy that has added initial pressure on inflation and the exchange rate.  During the past financial year, the economy battled limited foreign currency availability, inflation weighing on disposable incomes, exchange rate volatility and the wide disparity between official and parallel market rates. “This has made it difficult for industry players to meet the expectations of both policyholders and fund members. As a result, FBC Insurance is focusing on increasing the underwriting of foreign currency-denominated businesses to preserve value,” said Mr Kufazvinei. During the review period, Statutory Instrument 81 of 2023, also known as “no insurance premium, no cover,” was introduced to protect the insurance industry from dishonest creditors. The regulation aims to enhance the industry’s liquidity and claims settlement capacity. As a result, Mr Kufazvinei revealed that FBC Insurance would continue to evaluate the company’s asset and liability management strategies to align revenues with the risk-based capital requirements. Overall, the country anticipates broader financial market regulations, as both monetary and fiscal authorities strive to address market liquidity, price and exchange rate disparities, as well as public debt arrears to support economic growth and job creation. “In this environment, the group is well-prepared to leverage market opportunities and sustain shareholder value. It is critical to maintain an efficient and cost-effective business, coupled with the agility to move and take advantage of opportunities,” he said. "

Total foreign debt climbed to US$168 billion from US$164,5 billion at the end of September and US$162,9 billion at the end of December 2022. Egypt has quadrupled its external debt since 2015, using it to finance various initiatives such as constructing new capital, developing infrastructure, procuring weaponry, and sustaining an overvalued currency, Reuters reported. The central bank reported that the foreign debt, of which 82,5 percent was long-term, amounted to 43 percent of the gross domestic product. Following the Ukraine crisis, which resulted in a chronic shortage of foreign currency and prompted an exodus of foreign investors, the government of Egypt sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The country deliberately allowed its currency to weaken by over 35 percent in a much-anticipated devaluation, potentially opening the door for additional loans from the IMF. In March, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a US$5 billion augmentation to its loan program for Egypt. The approval increased the Extended Fund Facility arrangement from the initially approved US$3 billion in December 2022 to US$8 billion. The IMF has consistently advocated for Egypt to implement tighter monetary policies to address nearly 30 percent inflation and adopt a more flexible official exchange rate. As part of the agreement, Egypt committed to reducing spending on large government projects.  – Business Insider Africa "

This takes Congo one step closer to completing an IMF programme for the first time.  Previous agreements have been derailed by issues including a lack of transparency in its vast mining sector. “Performance under the (three-year) program has been generally positive, with most quantitative objectives met and key reforms implemented, albeit at a slow pace,” the Fund said in a statement. Once approved by the IMF board, the agreement will allow for the disbursement of a final tranche of around US$200 million. The IMF noted that the world’s top supplier of cobalt – the mineral used in smartphones – and the third-largest producer of copper must account for the positive impact of a recently amended Sicomines joint venture with Chinese companies in its revised budget law for 2024. “In addition, mechanisms will need to be put in place or reinforced to ensure the proper use and governance of these funds,” the Fund said. President Felix Tshisekedi pushed for the revision of the 2008 infrastructure for minerals deal with Sinohydro Corp and China Railway Group to bring more benefits for Congo. An agreement was signed in March. “The IMF is concerned about the mechanisms for using this money and has asked for it to be paid into the public treasury accounts rather than being managed by an agency as has been done in the past,” a finance ministry official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters. – The East African "
https://www.herald.co.zw/sa-vehicle-industry-achieves-r21bn-positive-trade-balance/,SA vehicle industry achieves R21bn positive trade balance,"Record vehicle exports helped take South Africa’s car trade balance to a positive R21,1 billion in 2023 from R19,6 billion in 2022 – an increase of 7,6 percent. Norman Lamprecht, chief trade and research officer at motor vehicle business council Naamsa, said on Tuesday vehicle exports have remained the key driver for the automotive industry’s healthy trade balance since 2008. “Despite a constrained economic environment undermining the domestic new vehicle market’s ability to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, record-high vehicle exports ensured that the automotive industry outperformed the rest of the manufacturing sector,” he said. “As the largest manufacturing sector in the country’s economy, a substantial 21,9 percent of value addition within the domestic manufacturing output was derived from vehicle and automotive component manufacturing in 2023, while the broader automotive industry’s contribution to the GDP comprised 5,3 percent – 3,2 percent manufacturing and 2,1 percent retail.” The industry has now achieved a positive trade balance since 2015, according to the annual Automotive Trade Manual, previously named the Automotive Export Manual, which was released this week. However, the motor vehicle trade balance figures exclude aftermarket parts, which recorded a negative trade balance of R99,5 billion in 2023. Automotive export revenue grew by 19,1 percent to a record R270,8 billion in 2023 from R227,3 billion in 2022. Lamprecht said this could mainly be attributed to a record vehicle export performance, resulting in vehicle export revenue increasing by 29,9 percent to R203,9 billion in 2023 from R157 billion in 2022. He said automotive component exports decreased by 4,8 percent to R66,9 billion in 2023 from R70,3 billion in 2022, which is in line with lower catalytic converter exports. The value of automotive imports increased by 20.2 percent to R249,7 billion in 2023 from R207,7 billion in 2022. Lamprecht attributed this mainly to the 34,3 percent year-on-year increase in the imports of original equipment components in 2023, which was to accommodate new model launches by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the domestic market. Lamprecht said the objectives of the South African Automotive Masterplan (SAAM) 2021-2035 are to increase vehicle production to 1.4 million vehicles per annum by 2035 and raise localisation levels in SA-manufactured vehicles from an average of 40 percent to 60 percent by 2035, which will contribute to decreasing reliance on imported components in the future. Exports to the EU, the domestic automotive industry’s top export region, increased to a record R147,1 billion in 2023, while exports to Africa, its second-largest export region, rose to a record R42,8 billion. Lamprecht said given the high export exposure of the domestic automotive industry to the EU, legislation to ban the sale of new internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the EU and UK by 2035 requires a speedy approach because of the required timeframe within which SA’s automotive industry must respond to this challenge. – Moneyweb "

Statistics show that imports increased by 12 percent to US$1,41 billion in the first two months of 2024 from US$1,26 billion in the same period in 2023, reflecting a trade deficit of US$234 million. NatFoods has invested in a cereal extrusion plant worth US$4,4 million, replaced a flour milling plant in Bulawayo for US$6 million and established a pasta line for US$5,6 million. Zimbabwe imports an average of US$40 million pasta annually, which the country can produce locally. NatFoods’ past plant produces about 1 200 tonnes per month against national demand of around 3 500 tonnes. Zimbabwe is also grappling with an influx of biscuits mainly from South Africa and Zambia, but investments by NatFoods could help whittle down the imports when it commissions a biscuit line later this month. Import substitution is a key priority in the National Development Strategy 1 (2021-2025) as Zimbabwe seeks to structurally transform its economy to increase manufactured value-added products. Speaking during the National Foods Stirling Workington tour, Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu said the Government was impressed by the firm’s immense contribution towards the growth of the local economy particularly the vision to import substitutes. “I think it is very important for the nation to appreciate what our business sector is doing, contributing towards the growth of our economy.  “What impresses me more is that you are targeting those products where we are spending a lot of our hard-earned foreign currency, importing. This is a very key policy position for the government, and we will be working with them to see what policy measures will be critical “In the next few months, we will be tracking to see the import substitution levels, and this calls for Government support wherever we can to ensure that we do promote import substitution,” said Minister Ndhlovu. NatFoods chief executive officer, Mr Michael Lashbrook said his company would remain committed to curbing importation of basic (food) commodities in the country. “We have invested heavily in these new platforms in the last three years, we have put around US$40 million into new projects, and many of these products are for import substitution. “This includes a pasta line, it is very interesting how Zimbabwe is consuming 3 500 tonnes of pasta per month, and all of our pasta at the moment is imported, there are no pasta plants in Zimbabwe, but we can produce all the pasta needed in the country with potential to export. “Currently, we can produce about 1 200 tonnes per month, so we can fulfill about a third of the national demand, we have currently put technology for macaroni, spaghetti is a different technology that we look forward to installing. Most of Zimbabwe’s pasta is sourced from Egypt and Mozambique. “We are in the process of establishing a US$7,7 million biscuit plant, it is crazy that we import a lot of biscuits from South Africa and Zambia, why don’t we make them here, because again biscuits are in essence flour, sugar, and a bit of fat which we locally have, we should be producing those locally,” he said. “We are saying this is crazy because we are surplus producers of wheat as a country, pasta is basically wheat flour and water. Why are we as a country importing pasta when there is raw material locally? He said we have managed to fund these with our resources and we are very excited this is going "
https://www.herald.co.zw/castle-tankard-gives-new-stars-stage-to-shine/,Castle Tankard gives new stars stage to shine,"Arts Reporter Sungura ace, Alick Macheso, is showing no signs of fading. His weekend performance at the Castle Tankard, attended by thousands of people in Harare, is testimony to this. After Master H, Freeman, Bling 4, DJs Fantan, Ribhe and Levels performed, Macheso and his Orchestra Mberikwazvo band came on to the stage at around 7pm. The sungura doyen did not disappoint his fans, churning out his old hits like “Shedia” and “Waikupanei Gungwa”, with the revellers backing him and singing along to his songs. He also performed a new song, “Wajaira Kundirova Ndakadhakwa”, which is on his album to be released in August. On stage, Macheso was accompanied by his dancer Selemani “Majuice” Mpochi, who was overshadowed by new senior dancer Shame “Kariba”  Chidewo. Although Macheso was the main act of the concert, other musicians who were on the list per-formed well. Zimdancell sensation Emegy “Freeman” Chizanga nailed it when he performed his hit song,“Man to Man.” The trio of Chillspot Records DJs — Fantan, Ribhe and Levels — charmed the crowd. Fantan braved that day’s chilly weather by performing shirtless. Fast-rising Zimdancehall chanter, Hillary “Master H” Marufu was well-received by the revellers. Master H was happy to perform at the Castle Tankard for the first time. “I’m super excited to perform on this special occasion, this shows that the public is appreciating my music. “It gives me pride to see that thousands of people know all your lyrics, this shows I’m doing a great job in this industry,” he said. Another upcoming Zim-hip-hop artiste, Farai “Bling 4” Gadzani also put up a good show. He performed a song featuring Silent Killer titled “Tisu Takatyora Mabhanditi” that had the crowd on their feet. The Mbare-based musician was excited to be included in that big event and to rub shoulders with high-profile artistes like Freeman and Macheso. “I just want to thank the event organisers for including me on this special occasion,” he said. Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Delta Corporation head of corporate affairs Patricia Murambinda said the inclusion of upcoming artistes on the line up was of great importance as it thrust them into the                                             spotlight. “Events like these are attended by the masses, so adding the upcoming musicians can help them to gain fame. “So many people were asking us why we did not haveWinky D this time, he is not the only artiste we have in Zimbabwe. We have to give others a chance to perform at these events.” Murambinda  said that Delta wanted to nurture and promote young talent, and not only the famous names. “As Delta, we have many events that aim to promote young talent, like the Road to Fame and Chibuku Neshamwari Dance Festival. “We are not obliged to promote high-profile artistes only, but to uplift the upcoming  ones also,” said Murambinda.

https://www.herald.co.zw/the-unveiled-take-fans-to-the-next-level-at-dvd-recording/,The Unveiled take fans to ‘The Next Level’ at DVD recording,"Entertainment Editor Young, vibrant and smart choral outfit, The Unveiled, left an indelible mark during their DVD recording held on Saturday at 7 Arts Theatre in Avondale, Harare. The recording, which ran under the theme, “Next Level – Making Jesus Famous,” saw the auditorium packed to the rafters as fans enjoyed every moment. The group’s new songs were well-received by the crowd. The new songs include “Mweya Mutsvene,” “Dururai Mweya Mutsvene,” “Warrior,” “Take Over,” and “Rise Up.” True to their name, they unveiled themselves to the world with a performance that suggested that they could be the next big thing to happen in Zimbabwe’s music industry. They stamped their authority on the gospel genre as the next act to take over the baton from The Charambas, Shingisai Suluma, Prince Mafukidze, Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave, and Mechanic Manyeruke among others. The youthful group brings a new vibe, energy and style to the gospel music scene. With such music, they are not only entertaining the young and old, but are challenging the established musicians to step up their game. The event was divided into  in two segments — first, they came clad in African attire which matched their cool, worship songs and the second one was the up-tempo dance vibe. They performed the crowd-favourite “Tungamira,” which sent the fans into a frenzy. They were later joined on stage by seasoned gospel singer Tembalami to perform “Gore Rino”. The show indeed took fans to the “Next Level”. It also saw top local musicians like Janet Manyowa, Everton Mlalazi, The Cherayis, and Tembalami performing. The “elders”, as they were christened at the show, put up a good performance with their old hits. Each time they were on stage, they pledged their support to the new “babies” in the game. Comedian “Nigel Tha Slick Pastor” sailed flawlessly as the master of ceremony. This time around he didn’t bring his comic attire on stage,  but was clad in a black slim-fit suit, as a sign of respect to the DVD recording. The event was well attended by local gospel musicians, including the Makombes, who just flew in the country ahead of their collaboration with local acts for their show next month. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/cresta-mbare-the-last-supper/,Cresta Mbare: The last supper,"Talent Chimutambgi-Lifestyle Writer It is almost mid-morning in Harare’s sprawling suburb of Mbare and some of the trendiest and latest vehicles compete for parking space. Out of the cars alight ladies and gentlemen clad in expensive designer clothes looking for a sumptuous lunch. Here, everything from shops to houses, roads is inexplicably busy. Ordinarily, this is not a good place to be. To many Americans and Western Europeans, Mbare is a classic example of a ghetto, what Trench Town is to Jamaica; a place for the poor and vice; a place where nothing right happens.  “Can anything good come out of Trench Town?” Bob Marley would sing. At the main business complex everything is busy and dilapidated, but here, there is one place that attracted the who-is-who of Harare. This place was called “Cresta Mbare”. Cresta is one of Southern Africa’s biggest hospitality groups running hotels and restaurants that offer delicious food tapestries. Remember Jameson Hotel, Cresta Oasis Hotel, Cresta Lodge and Cresta Churchill, that are all run professionally?  There must be something uniquely special for some ramshackle backyard eating place in Mbare to be equated to Cresta’s delicacies. The brains behind Cresta Mbare was Gogo Samuriwo Mutuma, an larger than life character who made every customer felt loved and at home.  Gogo Samuriwo It was her magic touch that made the rich and famous to leave the most decent hotels in Harare and navigate their way to Mbare. She was the magnet that brought people of diverse backgrounds together. Gogo Samuriwo-Mutuma started his catering business around 1980 at her home serving vendors and revellers at Mbare Musika and in town using a car as a mobile restaurant. At her house along Mzingeli Street, she continued to operate a kitchen until she was forced to abandon the home business during “Operation Murambatsvina” which was aimed at cleaning up towns. Before her husband who was a Harare City Council employee died in 1999, he had helped  her formalise her business to meet  elementary catering standards. She started her canteen trading under the name “Bisto” because she used to use Bisto relish powder in her soups and stews.  She did not name the place Cresta, as it was popularly known, but it was the customers who coined the name because they believed the dishes and service being offered were actually better or of the same quality with the renowned hotel group. She used to supply Chibuku Breweries employees in the industrial areas with sadza during lunch hour, but ended up opening a branch in situ.  Gogo Samuriwo was known for her usual saying to the customers, “ Sadza for the smart gentleman. One big mukombe for murume wanhasi. Big piece for madam. Vakomana ngavapihwe sadza rakawanda vanoputa fodya. More meat for musikana akageza.” She was familiar with her surroundings since she grew up in Mbare and went to Chirodzo Primary School and Harare High. Her son, Munyaradzi, said Gogo was very determined having started her canteen some years back. “This attracted most prominent people to come and buy food at the canteen. Most of them included renowned businessmen Philip Chiyangwa, and Wicknell Chivhayo as well as former ministers Webster Shamu and David Parirenyatwa and former Mashonaland governor Feber Chidarikire, among other prominent figures,” said Munyaradzi. “Soccer clubs that used to frequent the place include Dynamos, Masvingo United, Harare City Football Club and the now defunct Blackpool.  “Some of the famous Mbare footballers like the late Ashton Nyazika, and Lewis Kutinyu all ate there. Also, the Chillspot Family and other Zimdancehall artistes like Sir Calaz and the late Soul Jah Love were regular customers.” Munyaradzi said Gogo Samuriwo achieved a lot through her entrepreneurship skills. “Through her business, Gogo Samuriwo bought properties in Mufakose (where she stayed until her death), in Belvedere West, Westgate and Mbare. She also has a farm in Norton,” he said. As an accomplished Zanu PF party cadre who was brave, her home was used for political meetings even during her absence. Hazel Muguti, Gogo Samuriwo’s daughter, who is currently in the United Kingdom, said her mother did not discriminate against anyone, adding  that she was a mother to the whole community.  Gogo Samuriwo (left) and her daughter Hazel “Our mother taught us to treat everyone with great respect and she would insist that a child does not belong to the parents, but to the whole community. The statement itself indicates the type of mother she was,” said Hazel. “She was a loving mother, she loved everyone despite your background and here we grew up mingling with children from extended families, but one couldn’t see the difference because we were treated equally. To us and the entire community, her death is a huge loss, and even in the political space,” she said. “Her relationship with her husband was so close. Despite having liberation war credentials, she at one time to have seemed abandoned politics until her husband encouraged her to the extent of becoming more active than ever.” Hazel said, her mother taught her to treat other people with love and respect. However her death came as a surprise.  She said her mother used to buy medication for other people in the community, and she pledged to continue the legacy that she had left. Daughter-in-law, Hellen Muguti said her late mother-in-law had dispelled the misconception exist between the relationship of the two. “My mother-in-law took me as her daughter, I was amazed with the level of trust she could put to me. Sometimes she could leave me in charge of the canteen, but what was surprising was that she never bothered to ascertain if the cash was short,” said Hellen. Elder son Killian, who is Zanu PF councillor for Mbare, said he was ushered into politics by her mother. He said he was taught on how to engage people in politics, adding that Gogo told her that politics was not dirty, but it was the people who came with bad ideas. “My mother is the one who invited me into politics, she told me that most of the people think politics is dirty, but it becomes so when dirty people come in. I was strengthened by her words,” said Killian. He said Gogo Samuriwo could use her church experience as a devout Catholic to counsel young people in this community, especially those whose future seemed bleak. “Gogo helped a lot of people, she was a counsellor, she provided counselling to a lot of people and most of them could have committed suicide by now. She rejuvenated and revived a lot of people’s hopes. “Due to her good works, Zanu PF members in Mufakose nominated Gogo to represent the people in elections. As children, we are very happy that the Government under the leadership of President Mnangagwa recognised our mother,” he said. “Gogo Samuriwo could dress like a mother. She loved her community as she bought a transformer, and renovated roads in this community that were neglected here, but she used her money to assist the community,” added Killian. Her nephew, Nigel Mutumha, said she was the best at mobilising party cadres. “She used to be a dedicated and loyal Zanu PF member who played a significant role in mobilising and recruitment of party members, especially in the grassroots,” said Nigel. A neighbour to Gogo Samuriwo, Mrs Veronica Kahari, described her as a loving mother who was deeply involved in community social work.  “I have known Gogo Samuriwo since 1979 after being introduced to her by her daughter, Vivian, who was my friend. She was a good person with motherly qualities. “She used to bring leftovers from her kitchen and distribute them to neighbours. At the time of her death, she was now concentrating on the vulnerable groups, the elderly and orphans,” said Mrs Kahari. “Sometimes she could give people food hampers, she was a very sociable and peaceloving mother. In times of need she could donate even the last cent she had. She looke after more than 13 children who were in need,” she said. One of her employees, Mrs Tracy Mukonomuvi, said she was deeply saddened by the loss of Gogo Samuriwo, adding she was a patriotic cadre who could preach the good works of the ruling Zanu PF party. “We are all in deep sorrow following the passing on of Gogo, she was a good person who would always encourage us to follow the principles of the revolutionary party Zanu PF. She was loving and showed her love to everyone, she met” said Mrs Mukonomuvi. A neighbour, Mrs Eunika Mutoti, echoed Gogo Samuriwo’s love for the community, adding she was happy mother who could accommodate everyone.  Gogo Samuriwo and the Ireland ruby team. “Even the dogs in this community will remember  Gogo as a good neighbour. This place was a place of everyone. We learnt to share from her because whatever she had; she could share. We don’t know how this wound is going to heal,” said Gogo Mutoti. Cde David Mutukwa who spoke from the political side said Gogo Samuriwo was a staunch supporter of Zanu PF who could assist in various political activities. “This house was used for political activities. People could gather in this house, and most of aspiring legislators representing the ruling party came through her and used even to gather her to improve ways of mobilising people. She assisted a lot of families in cash or kind,” he said. “She became a dedicated cadre and rose through structures to the provincial level in the ruling Zanu PF party. She was a provincial member for two terms responsible for legal affairs. This was before she came down to the district level as the head of the Women’s League for Mufakose District 3 for more than 25 years,” said Cde Mutukwa. A long-time employee, Sheillah Nhokwara, said they had more to cherish on Gogo Samuriwo as anemployer. “Gogo Samuriwo was a determined woman; she was someone who wanted to empower women. She wanted everyone to be self-dependent. He taught us a lot of things. I have been  this canteen for the past 16 years. Some people tried to influence me to quit the job, but I remained steadfast because I knew that Gogo had a unique personality,” said Sheillah. Gogo Samuriwo was laid to rest at her rural home in Chihota last Friday. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/show-some-love-on-mothers-day/,Show some love on Mother’s Day,"Laina Makuzha-LOVE by DESIGN “Despite the many cultural differences that exist and differing expectations of motherhood throughout history and the world, one thing remains constant: a recognition that mothers have a uniquely important, valuable role in helping children to thrive,” those wise words from Christine Gross-Loh, author of “Parenting Without Borders: Surprising Lessons Parents Around the World Can Teach Us” — ring true to this day. Tomorrow is Mother’s Day. A worthy commemoration in my view.  I see Mother’s Day as a special occasion and opportunity to pause from our ever busy lives and hustles, to express our love, gratitude, and admiration more deliberately, for the incredible women who have shaped our lives.  Whether they are biological mothers, grandmothers, aunts, guardians, sisters, or mentors, colleagues, those from church — pastor or pastor’s wife, these remarkable individuals deserve our heartfelt appreciation.  This week we take a moment to remind ourselves of the significance of, and share thoughts on how to foster love within our homes.  Contrary to popular belief that only women are celebrated and focussed on, we do have Father’s Day following hard on the heels of Mother’s Day, on the third Sunday of next month.  So we get to honour and celebrate the fathers that have directed and shaped our lives, next month.  Be ready.  Just thought I’d throw that in there, lest we forget. Motherhood really extends beyond biological ties. It encompasses the nurturing love and care provided by sisters, colleagues, church mates, and even pastors’ wives. Honouring all mother figures beyond biology, is a wonderful way to recognise the value every woman can have in nurturing society, not necessarily through biological parenting but the heart and willingness to impart good values in others that comes naturally to some.  Society can recognise and celebrate all those who play a maternal role in one’s life. Their impact is phenomenal and immeasurable. Acts of kindness On Mother’s Day, everyone can choose to participate. Perhaps you’ve been there for your mother, aunt or someone whose impact in your life was that of a mother. Pick up the phone and make that call, or better still visit if you can.  If there’s been tension, this is a good time to bury the hatchet, turn a new leaf and mend those relationships. You can visit an old people’s home to honour the mothers and grandmothers there whom society might have forgotten.  Spend time, cheer them up, do something — maybe cook for them, offer some appropriate recreation or support in any way you can, even if it’s just by your presence.  If you’re a husband, consider these ways to honour your wife in addition to gifts you may have in mind: Improved communication: Think of the things she has complained about in your relationship. Commit to being better.  Listen actively and with understanding and express your feelings openly too, to improve your bond. Encourage children (though usually they hardly need cranking), to honour their mother and be kind to her.  Shared Responsibilities: If you haven’t been actively supporting your wife, now is a good time to change.  Share household responsibilities and show appreciation for her efforts. Also share the important vision and dreams you have as individuals. You are not alone in that marriage.  Too many couples vanoita “mazvake-mazvake” for example in the area of finances.  I suggest kuita zvinhu zvenyu together as a couple  because a house divided against itself cannot stand.  Mothers celebrating themselves and one another And to all my sisters, mothers from all walks of life, it’s your day: don’t wait to be spoiled!  This day is about celebrating you, what God invested in you. You can make the day special for those around you too, or encourage a fellow mother. And whether your own mother is alive or not, there’s much to cherish and do in her honour.   Here are some ideas to honour mothers: Cook a special meal: Prepare a beautiful meal for your family as they celebrate you with you. Food shared with love nourishes not only the body but also the soul and it sets a beautiful atmosphere for bonding. Acts of kindness: Extend your love beyond your family, share a meal with friends or neighbours if you feel the need to do so.  Perform acts of kindness for those who don’t have a mother figure in their lives. You might know a lonely elderly woman who lives alone, spare a thought or reach out if you can. A biblical perspective Proverbs: 31 describes the virtuous woman, a wife and mother who embodies strength, wisdom, and compassion.  Her actions inspire us to foster love within our homes. Husbands can learn from her example and honour their wives by appreciating their tireless efforts. Just think of all the things she stands for, the role she plays day in, day out, it can be cumbersome. It is therefore befitting to let her know she is truly appreciated. Ultimately, Mother’s Day is a reminder to cherish the women who have shaped us.  Let’s celebrate all mothers — biological and otherwise — for their unwavering love, sacrifice, and nurturing spirit. As we honour them, we are aware no one is perfect, so let’s also reflect on the transformative power of love and kindness we can extend towards them.  So, till next edition, Happy Mother’s Day to every remarkable woman out there!  Receive your flowers.  Happy Mother’s Day too, to everyone born of a mother and thank God for them, alive or not. Their love, and sacrifice can never be forgotten, you are their legacy.  Let’s keep the conversation going. I do know, a day like this can be difficult for some whose mothers are no longer with us. I can relate, having lost my own mother very painfully in 2013.  So you are welcome to express your thoughts, experiences and great memories of departed mothers, your own motherhood experience or if you are just needing ways to go through the day.

https://www.herald.co.zw/mothers-day-traditions-around-the-world/,Mother’s Day traditions around the world,"There are a lot of holidays throughout the year, but there’s only one Mother’s Day. Landing tomorrow, don’t forget to let that all-important woman in your life know just how much she means to you and how thankful you are for all she does. From lending an ear when you need someone to listen to doling out that one-of-a-kind mom advice, it’s a mother that seems to always know just the right thing to say and do. To celebrate her in style, we have gathered a list of Mother’s Day activities to do with your mom, stepmom, grandmother, aunt, wife, daughter, friend or anyone else you’re honouring this year. However, a lot has been written and said about this day but what are some of the traditions across the world. In honour of Mother’s Day, we set out to discover how different cultures across the globe celebrate moms. In many US, households, the second Sunday in May begins with breakfast in bed, a bouquet of flowers, homemade cards, and other tokens of affection for mom.  Mother’s Day in the US has been an official holiday since 1914. In other corners of the globe, honouring Mom is a rite grounded in local traditions and customs — some ancient, some surprisingly new. “Most cultures celebrate mothers because they are traditionally the main caregiver, which comes with great responsibility,” says Mei-Ling Hopgood, author of How Eskimos Keep Their Babies Warm: And Other Adventures in Parenting. Here, we take you on a quick trip around the world to discover how moms in five different countries are celebrated and to provide some inspiration for your own day. Share our “bring it home” ideas with your family. India: 10-Day Festival In the fall, Hindus honour the goddess Durga during the 10-day festival known as Durga Puja. The celebration is thought to date back to the sixteenth century and is considered both a religious ceremony and a time for family reunions. One story tells of Durga returning to her parents’ home to show off her own children. Families spend weeks preparing food, gathering gifts, and decorating their homes for the festival. Bring it home: Visit other moms you know, among both friends and family, and bring home-cooked goods to share. Japan: The Right Flowers Mother’s Day is celebrated in Japan on the second Sunday in May, as in the United States. The traditional gift is carnations.  Bring it home: Thank the moms in your community who help your family by writing notes of gratitude. Tie the notes to carnations and leave the flowers on the moms’ doorsteps. Ethiopia: Sing Along! The Antrosht festival, observed at the end of the rainy season in early fall, is dedicated to moms. After the weather clears for good, family members from all over flock to their homes for a large meal and celebration. Daughters traditionally bring vegetables and cheese, while sons supply meat. Together, they prepare a meat hash and sing and perform dances that tell stories of family heroes. Bring it home: Share stories about all the women in your family. Go through your photo albums together and create a personal scrapbook of those special moms who’ve come before you. United Kingdom: A Church Custom Mothering Sunday” falls on the fourth Sunday of Lent. Back in the 1700s, the day was marked by young house servants returning home to spend time with their mothers. That custom evolved from an earlier one in which families who had moved away would return to the original church they attended. Today, the holiday remains grounded in religion, with many churches handing out daffodils for children to give to Mom. Traditionally, girls also bake a fruitcake for their mothers. Bring it home: Ask your family to celebrate you on Mother’s Day by launching a new tradition based on one from your own childhood. France: Medals for Mom In 1920, the government of France began awarding medals to mothers of large families in gratitude for helping rebuild the population after so many lives were lost in World War I. After the second World War, the government declared the last Sunday in May to be the Day of Mothers. The traditional gift is now a flower-shaped cake. Bring it home: Awarding medals for bringing children into the world is obviously outdated, but expressing gratitude never goes out of style  — especially when you’re demonstrating ways to express it to your children. Share your thankfulness for each family member at dinner and ask them each to do the same. — today.com/history.com "
https://www.herald.co.zw/quality-over-quantity-the-key-to-sustainable-change/,Quality over quantity: The key to sustainable change,"Coach Kelly-Fitness Correspondent This week, we delve into the world of habit formation and achieving results.  Often, the focus falls on sheer quantity — doing more reps at the gym, eating countless salads, or working endless hours.  But what if the secret lies in form? Here’s why prioritising quality over quantity might be the key to unlocking sustainable change: Lifestyle Integration: Small, well-formed habits are easier to integrate into your everyday life.  Think of a brisk 20-minute walk or a short, effective gym session you can fit into your routine. Consistency is vital for long-term success. Influence and Peer Pressure: Imagine a friend effortlessly maintaining a healthy weight through mindful eating choices versus someone constantly on restrictive diets.  The friend with good form inspires positive change through a more sustainable approach. Changing Behaviour: Sustainable change comes from understanding the “why” behind your actions.  Focusing on form allows you to explore healthier choices and build intrinsic motivation, leading to long-term behavioural shifts. What You Eat: A single, well-balanced meal packed with nutrients is more beneficial than mindlessly filling your plate with low-quality food. Quality trumps quantity when it comes to nourishing your body. Workplace Arrangements: Prioritising focused work sessions over long, unproductive hours can lead to better results. Creating a work environment that promotes well-being and efficiency fosters sustainable performance. Get Active, Your Way! Regular exercise is crucial for overall health and well-being.  Consider incorporating movement you enjoy into your routine.  Here is a work out routine you can follow for a week: Monday: Strength Training Superset 1: Exercise 1: Goblet squat: 12 reps Exercise 2: Lat pull-down or pull-up (you can use the machine or a resistance band): 12 reps for lat pull-down or five reps for pull-up Do four sets Superset 2: Exercise 1: Step-up: 10 reps each leg (to make this more challenging, hold two five- to 10-pound dumbbells by your sides.)

Do a walking workout, sprint intervals, a bike ride, or laps in the pool — it’s up to you. Most importantly, work hard. Friday: Conditioning It’s time to finish the week strong. Today’s workout is going to feel a little more challenging than the other strength workouts you did earlier in the week.

One of the most crucial things you can do to achieve your goals is to be consistent. Today, all you have to do is rest. Walk around, stretch, ride your bike, foam roll, or do something that makes you feel good and will prepare you for next week.

https://www.herald.co.zw/chioma-umeala-pushes-for-more-diversity-in-anime/,Chioma Umeala pushes for more diversity in animé,"Masego Seemela-Youth Interactive Correspondent The “Woman King” star Chioma Umeala is driven by closing the gap in terms of representation for black women in the world of animé. The young actor is known for her performance in Netflix’s popular live-action adaptation of the manga series, “One Piece”, slipping into character as feisty Nojiko.  This weekend she will take to the main stage at Comic Con Africa in Cape Town, joining a panel discussion that delves deeper into the process and experience of making the series.  “I’m seizing this opportunity as a way to bring in more diversity. Yes, it’s a nerd convention but I believe the narrative has changed where we think a ‘nerd’ is a white man with glasses. Some of us don’t look like that but we like animé, hence it’s importance to show our faces in such a medium,” she said. “Black people are commonly known to be the last ones on the screen.  With us showing our interest in such a medium, we stand a better chance of dominating these spaces.”  Umeala got a life-changing experience acting alongside Oscar winner Viola Davis and Mzansi’s very own Thuso Mbedu in “The Woman King” in 2022. “I have always been a fan of storytelling since I was quite young. I love stories being told in any medium, be it podcasts, film, television or theatre. Animé is just that in another medium,” she said. “Often people think that animé is a genre or division but it can be split into many things. There are different ranges, from comedy to drama or horror.  “The reason why we tend to resonate with cartoons more is that it allows us to explore worlds beyond our imagination. It allows us to take storytelling to another dimension.” Umeala recalled growing up on the comic series Supa Strikas and being a die-hard fan of “Dragon Ball Z”.  “My nickname is Gigi, who is Goku’s wife; having such a childhood where you see animé exist in your world meant quite a lot to me as a child hence I’d love that for the younger generation, specifically young black girls,” she said.  The half-Nigerian and half-South African performer, who got her breakout role in daily drama “Isono”, takes pride in her multi-cultural identity and heritage. “From my generation, even younger, there’s no fighting the reality that we are a mixed nationality. We also have people from many different African countries living here and are spread across the world. I’ve always known that I am a product of two people from two different countries who created me,” she said.  “I am one of many variations who are like me. I know so many half-Nigerians and -Xhosa or half-Nigerian and-Pedi but we are culturally South Africans.  “So, instead of fighting that reality, I want to be a representation of how enriching it is to come from diversity within our diaspora.” Umeala encouraged Africans to embrace their uniqueness through storytelling, which she described as a superpower.  “As Africans, we don’t all speak in the same accent or even eat the same food. So, with us showcasing who we are from our different cultures, we are giving the world a culturally enriching experience and not just one dimension of all Africans,” she said.  “We’re a big continent and our stories are yet to be told through the vast mediums at our disposal. We need to dominate these forms of storytelling.” "
https://www.herald.co.zw/every-student-was-born-out-of-a-mother/,Every student was born out of a mother,"Latwell Nyangu-Youth Interactive Writer Students often find themselves reflecting on the impact their mothers have had on their lives. From the early years of childhood to adulthood, mothers play a crucial role in shaping their children’s values, beliefs, and behaviours. As students grow and mature, they begin to appreciate the sacrifices, love, and guidance that their mothers have provided throughout their lives. To the most amazing mothers, Happy Mother’s Day! Your kindness, strength, and guidance have made us who we are today. This week I bring a word of appreciation to our mothers. I understand some of us haven’t had the love of our mothers. Some didn’t even have an opportunity to see their mothers. There are however some who have rogue mothers, while some are blessed to have good mothers. May those who haven’t had their Mothers love, find comfort from the Lord and those who care for them. At times when I write I also understand some scenarios and situations which some of us go through on a daily basis. But it shall be well. Tomorrow is a day to celebrate Mother’s Day. As students, you come from different backgrounds and today we acknowledge biological mothers, stepmothers, foster mothers, surrogate mothers, single mothers, working moms, military moms, and other mothers, through relations or associations. Their job is still tireless and often thankless. When it is done right, the job is still about unconditional love, even when that means showing tough love. Many times, if we don’t make a point to intentionally and fully express our gratitude to our mothers regularly or at least once a year, we run the risk of forgetting to appreciate one of the most fundamental truths about our lives; that we only exist because of our mothers. It remains a lifelong commitment. Even after a child matures, graduates, and is gainfully employed, they will still look up to their mothers. I have noticed that some students go astray due to a lack of mother’s love, and in such cases they tend not to care. Some abscond from lectures because they have no support from their mothers. Some end up quitting school when they don’t have mothers. In most cases, the first person to be blamed for children’s failures is often the mother. If an adult child weds or even procreates, the mother continues to look after her grandchildren. They cut the umbilical cord at birth, but there are other bonds that stay intact. Mothers are the glue that holds our lives together. They coddled and cuddled us when we could do nothing for ourselves.  As we grew, they were our nurses, doctors, dieticians, and psychologists. They taught us, protected us, preached to us, guided and guarded us, they were uncanny human lie detectors and untiring sounding boards. Mothers laughed at our jokes, no matter how corny they were, and cried with us when our hearts were breaking. When we are in trouble, our mothers feed us and clothe us. Mothers are many individuals rolled into one. When we go back to college, mothers remain on our backs to make sure we are well catered for. Mostly when students have issues, they first address them to their mothers before taking them to their fathers. If you delay going home, mothers are the first to check on you as students. So, for Mother’s Day, we have a few special wishes for the mothers out there — any age, any stage of life, and with any prefix or modifier in front of the word mother. As students’ progress through academic journey, and face challenges along the way, they start to recognize the valuable lessons that their mothers have imparted to them. Whether it’s teaching them the importance of hard work, resilience in the face of adversity, or kindness towards others, students come to appreciate the wisdom and guidance that their mothers have shared with them. These lessons shape students’ character and influence how they navigate the complexities of life. I hope you are going to make your mother feel special on this day. As students reach milestones such as graduation or embark on new adventures in college or careers, they often take a moment to reflect on the unwavering support and encouragement they have received from their mothers. Gratitude fills their hearts as they realise the sacrifices made by their mothers to ensure they have a bright future ahead. Students express appreciation for the countless hours spent helping with homework, attending parent-teacher conferences, and providing emotional support during challenging times. Mother’s Day is a celebration honouring the mother of the family or individual, as well as motherhood, maternal bonds, and the influence of mothers in society. It is celebrated on different days in many parts of the world, most commonly in March or May. Let’s send a very heartfelt Happy Mother’s Day to all the moms out there. On a typical morning, we wake up with a whole reality waiting for us. Before the day passes us by, pick up the phone or say a silent prayer letting her know how much you appreciate the greatest gift you could ever receive Flowers would be nice. Take them out, pay the bills. Until we meet for a toast, let’s love our mothers Feedback: [email protected] "
https://www.herald.co.zw/wake-up-work-hard-make-your-dreams-a-reality/,"‘Wake up, work hard, make your dreams a reality’","Primrose Chibharo-Harare High School student From May 1-3, 2024, I had the privilege of being among the five Harare High learners, along with pupils from other schools, to attend the Dream Big Conference hosted by the International Youth Fellowship (IYF) in partnership with the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education.  The conference was held at the Harare Girls High School.  We met various speakers who encouraged us to wake up, work hard and make our dreams a reality. Pastor Yang Kyeong Chan, the IYF country director, started his presentation by asking us, “What is your dream?”  This made everyone wonder what their dream was.  He encouraged us by using the story of the Wright Brothers, who had a dream to see a flying machine. They didn’t just dream about it; they invented one.  They made their dream a reality, which is why we are talking about them today.  From this story, I learned that unless you work hard, you will never attain what you want in life.  He concluded his presentation by giving us the recipe for success: capital (money), good people, and a good market or environment. Miriam Jani, an executive producer at ZBC, encouraged us to work hands-on to gain experience in what we want to accomplish in life.  For example, when you want to work in a medical field, a student can consider going to a nearby clinic and volunteer their services to gain experience.  She encouraged us to research more on what we want to be, so as to gain clarity on what we will become in the future. Local actor cum producer Zolile Makeleni talked about how we should cherish education as it is a privilege, not a right.  He said it was a privilege because not everyone could afford education. He mentioned that failing to dream is a disease, and every leaner  should have a dream, at least to have a good life or something beyond that. He said that the reason why most students failed was because they felt entitled to everything life offers, thereby killing their dreams.  During his presentation, he played a song by Winky D titled “Daddy.”  The song talks about a child who asks his parents what they are doing while other fathers are buying houses and companies and waking up early in the morning for work.  From that song, I was motivated to work hard so that my children will not ask me such thought-provoking questions.  He concluded his presentation by giving us the power of association, which encouraged us to always reflect on who we spend our time with, adding that our dreams are nurtured by those around us. The guest speaker of the conference was Dr Prof Choi Jong Eun, a mind education specialist (IMEI) from South Korea, who spoke about value.  He presented a picture of a key and said, “No matter how old the key gets, it always has value.”  “If there is a lock, the key holds great value.” From this, I learned that everyone has great value, and students should have a key to their discovery.  He also told us a story of a child who was autistic whose parents treated him like a disabled person. They would actually tell everyone that their child was disabled.  One day, the parents met a prophet who convinced them that their child was just like every other child, and he also made them promise to never treat him like he was disabled. From this example, he made us aware that different thinking produces different outcomes, meaning that if one thinks negatively, negativity is produced; therefore, we should always be positive.  He concluded by saying that the people, environment, and mindset determine the outcomes of our lives. The biggest lesson I would love to tell everyone is to dream big, aim high, and strive for success, and above all, to never give up.  Special thanks to Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, Honourable Torerayi Moyo, pastor Yang Kyeong Chan and Prof Jae Yun Shim, IYF chairman for Southern Africa, and all stakeholders for making this event a success and ensuring that every learner does not give up on their dreams.

https://www.herald.co.zw/miss-teen-usa-srivastava-relinquishes-title/,Miss Teen USA Srivastava relinquishes title,"UmaSofia Srivastava, who took home the 2023 title in September, shared a lengthy statement on Wednesday announcing her departure because her “personal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organisation.” “After months of grappling with the decision, I have made the choice to resign from the title of Miss Teen USA 2023. I am grateful for all the support from my family, my state directors, my sister queens, and the fans who have cheered me on since I won my state title,” Srivastava wrote.  “I will always look back on my time as Miss NJ Teen USA fondly, and the experience of representing my state as a first generation, Mexican-Indian American at the national level was fulfilling in itself.” In a statement shared with USA TODAY on Wednesday, Miss USA CEO and president Laylah Rose said, “Our all-encompassing goal at Miss USA is to celebrate and empower women. Our participants make a real difference in this country and around the globe.” Rose’s statement continued, “All along, my personal goal as the head of this organisation has been to inspire women to always create new dreams, have the courage to explore it all, and continue to preserve integrity along the way. I hold myself to these same high standards and I take these allegations seriously. Please be assured that the well-being of all individuals associated with Miss USA is my top priority.” In her resignation statement, Srivastava vowed to continue her philanthropy work with The Lotus Pedal Foundation and the Bridge of Books Foundation as she completes her junior year of high school. “While this was certainly not how I saw my reign coming to a close, I am excited to continue my advocacy for education and acceptance, start applying to colleges, and share some exciting new projects on  “That’s Fan Behaviour with those of you who plan to stick around,” she captioned the post, referring to her blog. Srivastava added: “At the end of the day, I am so lucky to have had the privilege of this experience, but if this is just a chapter, I know that the story of my life will truly be incredible.” “I LOVE YOU! So proud of you my angel,” former Miss USA Voigt commented.  On Monday, Voigt, who was awarded Miss USA in September 2023, announced her resignation in a statement on Instagram. The former title holder wrote, “In life, I strongly value the importance of making decisions that feel best for you and your mental health.” Her decision to relinquish her Miss USA crown has sparked a flurry of online speculation after fans noticed a strange detail about her statement. In the comments of her post and elsewhere on social media, users pieced the first letter in each sentence of her statement to reveal the phrase “I AM SILENCED” — though this discounts the last three sentences, the first letters of which spell “HIP.” It was not immediately clear whether the message was intentional. Miss USA previously said in a statement to USA TODAY, “We respect and support former Miss USA Noelia Voigt’s decision to step down from her duties. The well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritise herself at this time.” The statement added, “The organisation is currently reviewing plans for the transition of responsibilities to a successor and an announcement regarding the crowning of the new Miss USA will be coming soon.” Prior to Voigt’s announcement, Miss USA social media director Claudia Michelle shared on Instagram Friday that she has resigned from her role. In a statement posted to social media, she wrote, “I have had the privilege of getting to work with Noelia closely and have unfortunately seen a decline in her mental health since we (first) met. I feel like her ability to share her story and her platform have been diminished.” “I feel the way current management speaks about their titleholders is unprofessional and inappropriate,” she went on to write. “I disavow workplace toxicity and bullying of any kind.” – USTODAY "

                     Bennett, Raza seal consolation win for Zimbabwe
                    ","Brian Bennett's all-round show and Sikandar Raza's unbeaten 72 helped Zimbabwe seal a consolation win in the T20I series against Bangladesh. The visitors won by eight wickets in the fifth T20I to reduce the margin of the series defeat to 4-1. Bennett bossed both powerplays. He struck a breezy 70 in the chase after he took two wickets in the Bangladesh powerplay, finishing with 2-20. Raza finished the game with his first half-century on tour after four low scores. Mahmudullah's 54 kept Bangladesh in shape after they slipped to 15 for 3. It was his second half-century this year, as he strengthened his case to be part of Bangladesh's middle-order for the T20 World Cup. He shared a 69-run fourth wicket stand with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, who also showed some form with his 36. Zimbabwe's bowling, however, kept the home side in check, especially in the first few overs when they bowled two maiden overs. Bennett strikes early Bennett and Blessing Muzarabani stifled Bangladesh during powerplay. Muzarabani got Tanzid Hossain to top edge a slog in the second over, before Bennett removed Soumya Sarkar and Towhid Hridoy in successive overs. Sean Willams took the simple catch from a Soumya dab, at point. Hridoy was caught behind, unable to correctly judge the bounce of the ball as he went for the square cut. Bennett and Muzarabani also bowled a maiden each as the home side slipped to 15 for 3 in the fifth over. Mahmudullah rebuilds Mahmudullah countered Zimbabwe's dominance with three fours in the first four balls he faced. He started with a sweep, before hitting Bennett for a cover drive and finishing with a slice through point. He added 69 runs for the fourth wicket with Najmul Hossain Shanto. Luke Jongwe dropped Shanto on 25 at short third-man after the batter miscued a hoick against Wellington Masakadza. Shanto slammed Masakadza for his first six but his attempt at a repeat off the next ball went straight to Ryan Burl at deep midwicket. Mahmudullah launched Bennett over long-on for his only six, as he added 39 runs with Shakib Al Hasan for the fifth wicket. Johnathan Campbell's brilliant running catch from deep midwicket cut short Shakib's 17-ball 21, before Muzarabani had Mahmudullah caught at cover for 54. Bennett cracks on After impressing with the ball, Bennett got Zimbabwe off to a flyer with the bat. He struck Mahedi Hasan for two fours in the first over. He then smacked Mahedi for two sixes and a four in his next over, before hammering Saifuddin for two more fours in the fourth over. Shakib getting Marumani stumped in the fifth over slowed down Zimbabwe before Raza slammed Saifuddin over midwicket for his first six. Bennett went past his previous best in T20Is with a six off Rishad Hossain, before reaching his fifty in the 12th over. He struck two more sixes to take his tally to five sixes, before holing out to Saifuddin for 70 off 49 balls. He also struck five fours. Raza nails down the chase Raza, who supported Bennett in the 74-run second wicket stand, continued with the big hits after the opener's departure. He struck Saifuddin for two fours in the 16th over. It left Zimbabwe with 32 needed off the last four overs. He reached his fifty off 41 balls, reaching the mark with a four off a pull. Raza then deposited Saifuddin for a huge six over midwicket, following it with a six over long-off, and a four. He finished on an unbeaten 72 off 46 balls with four sixes and six fours. Campbell was unbeaten on eight runs, hitting the winning runs in the 19th over. "

He joins Makarawu who had already qualified for the same event in a time of 19.87s.  Mpofu was the first to  qualify  for the Olympics in December 2022 at the Valencia  Marathon, crossing the finishing line in a time of 2 hours  6 minutes 48 seconds whilst Nyahora earned her spot through  a universality wild card. Tagara noted that the positive move comparing with the previous edition where triple jumper Chengetayi Mapaya was the only one who met the qualifying standards for the Olympics from athletics. Considering that the fact that the door is still open for other athletes leaves a possibility of increasing the number. ""We are very happy that we have been one of the two associations out of 33 Olympic sport codes that have athletes who have qualified and met the standards of the Olympics. If one looks at what we had in the last edition, we had only one athlete who met the qualifying standards, Chengetayi Mapaya, but unfortunately he could not travel,"" said Tagara. ""We had targeted to have at least two or three marathon runners and also track athletes but now that we have both, we have fulfilled our mandate and hope to have more. There is quite a number of athletes that are close to qualifying who are based abroad. This gives us hope that we are doing well and if you look at Tapiwa Makarawu for example, his times are very impressive and if he mantains that standard, he can be in the semis or finals at the Olympics."" Tagara added that the  athletes are already preparing for the Paris Games. Mpofu has been in camp since January and  took a break after the Boston marathon last month before resuming  his camp on Monday under the guidance of his coach Benson Chauke. South Africa based, Nyahora, who is the only female that has qualified so far, will be working with her coach in South Africa and Tagara said that they will see if she can join Mpofu in the final weeks so that they can work and travel together. In order to help other athletes qualify, Tagara said they will send some athletes for the upcoming  Africa Senior Championships that will be held in Cameroon in June. "

                    ","Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) has agreed a long-term lease with the City of Gweru for the development of a new cricket stadium ahead of two major global events in the country.    The agreement, which relates to a 10 446-hectare piece of land in the Midlands capital, will be legally binding for 99 years.    ZC is looking to turn the plot into a multi-purpose stadium, including spectator stands, a VIP pavilion, a media centre, corporate boxes and an accommodation facility.    “This is a 99-year lease where Zimbabwe Cricket is going to come in to construct a state-of-the art cricket ground and us, as the City of Gweru, we are providing the space in terms of the land – it’s a 10-hectare (piece of) land so that at least they can put up all the facilities . . .” Gweru Town Clerk Livingston Churu said, explaining what the agreement entails.    “It’s actually a multi-discipline facility where you are going to have cricket, you are also going to have squash, I am sure, and all the other disciplines, even tennis. So that is how it’s structured.”    After signing off the agreement on behalf of the national cricket body on Friday, an elated ZC Managing Director Givemore Makoni said: “We are pretty excited we have put pen to paper on the lease agreement between Zimbabwe Cricket and the Gweru City Council.     “This is a huge milestone as far as cricket development is concerned, as it means we are bringing cricket to the Midlands province.   “One of our strategic objectives is to become the number one sport in the country and to achieve that we are taking the game to all four corners of the country.    “But without Gweru, the capital city of one of the major provinces, that strategic goal or milestone will not be reached.”   City of Gweru Mayor Martin Chivhoko welcomed the development, hailing it as a game changer for the Midlands capital.    “As a city we are happy with this partnership that we have entered with ZC for the growth of sport in our city,” the mayor said.   “It’s also going to improve our GDP as we are going to have visitors who will come for cricket matches in our city.”     The project has come at a time Zimbabwe is preparing to co-host two major global cricket tournaments, the ICC Under-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup 2026 and the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2027.    “As you know we are hosting the Under-19 Men’s World Cup in 2026 and the Men’s World Cup in 2027 and we will need  practice and match venues . . . Gweru will be used as one of the practice venues for the main events, especially in 2027,” Makoni said.    “Whenever you host major events it’s got a huge economic impact on a country and cities.   “Bringing countries or teams to Gweru will have a huge economic impact. The spinoff will be huge in terms of accommodation, tourism in the city, the number of players and cultural exchange and all that will be coming to Gweru . . .”   "

Both teams enter the match with momentum, having secured wins in their previous games. Agama FC recently handed Banket United their first defeat of the season, while Trojan FC celebrated a victory over CC Mhangura.Emson Chitsungo, chairperson of Agama Football Club, expressed confidence in his team's prospects for the upcoming match. “With the unwavering support from our club patrons, Malvern Moyo and Anne Antonio, there are no reasons why Agama will fail to secure three points from Trojan Football Club,” he declared. Echoing Chitsungo's sentiments, Agama’s vice chairperson, Willard Garanewako, highlighted the management’s efforts to boost player morale ahead of the crucial derby. “As part of the club's management, we are doing everything we can to motivate our players, ensuring they remain focused and spirited for this Mashonaland Central Derby,” said Garanewako. Garanewako further elaborated on the ethos of the club, encapsulated in its abbreviated name, AGAMA, which stands for Athletic, Gallant, Aspiring, Motivated, and Achievers.“So, 'AGAMA Football Club' could stand for 'Athletic Gallant Aspiring Motivated Achievers Football Club,' reflecting a team of determined and spirited individuals striving for excellence in their athletic pursuits,” he explained. He said this philosophy is a testament to the club’s ambition and the high standards they set for themselves on and off the pitch.The stakes are particularly high, as Agama currently sits two points and two places above Trojan in the league standings, occupying the eighth position with nine points, while Trojan is tenth with seven points. This derby is not just a battle for points but also for local bragging rights, setting the stage for an intense and thrilling encounter. As the teams prepare to face off, the entire Province watches with bated breath, anticipating a match that promises not only to showcase the spirit and skill of its players but also to ignite the passion of football fans across Mashonaland Central.     "

Voster, who managed 70 on the first day, made two eagles on the front nine and seven birdies to complete a record breaking round. A bogey on the 15th hole was the only blemish on an otherwise majestic performance by the South African golfer The 22-year-old golfer is now on 12 — under par after two rounds and is one stroke ahead of 2001 champion Darren Fichardt who carded 66 in the second round to finish the day on 11 — under par. Fichardt is tied for second place with Michael Hollick who managed 66 in the second, having shot a round of 67 on the first day. It was a fine afternoon for South African golfers who occupy the top five places on the leaderboard with Anthony Michael fourth on overall 10 — under par, while first round leader Jaco Ahlers is two shots behind on 8 — under par after a round of 71. Kieran Vincent was the country’s best placed golfer tied for 6th place with South Africans JC Ritchie and Combrinck Smit on overall 6 — under after a much improved performance of 5 — under par 67 yesterday. The 26-year-old golfer was happy with his performance. “Obviously a score is a score, but I felt my game was a lot similar to what happened yesterday. It was just that a couple of putts were holding, but all in all I have been hitting really well and I was happy to see a couple of putts going in. Obviously a 67 score is great anywhere you are,” he said. “Everything is going according to plan. We know there are low rounds out there with a 62 that was shot today, but we can just go out there and try tomorrow. You never know what can happen with 36 holes to go,” Kieran Vincent added.  It was also a good outing for local favourite Robson Chinhoi who managed a round of 68 in the second to go into the weekend on 4 – under and tied for 11th place on the leaderboard. Scott Vincent also struggled with his game on the second day after he made 1 — over par for an overall 4 — under par and tied for 11th place after two rounds.

                     Goal drought threatens DeMbare's chase
                    ","DYNAMOS have encountered real problems at this early stage of the season, and finishing is definitely one of them. In a campaign characterised by an array of things gone wrong, injuries to key players including skipper Frank Makarati and Tanaka Shandirwa, referee calls not going their way in some instances and a cat and mouse relationship between the club bosses and coach Genesis Mangombe: Little wonder it has been a slow start to their new campaign. The league title chasing side has scored just eight goals in their opening 10 games of the season, only better than six other competitors in the league. Three of the teams with fewer goals than Dynamos are Hwange, Chegutu Pirates and Arenel Movers, sides that currently occupy the bottom three places on the log table. The Harare giants' leading goal scorer is Emmanuel Paga who has netted three goals. Ahead of their match against Herentals at Rufaro Stadium tomorrow, Mangombe said he is worried about his players' inability to convert into goals the numerous chances they create. He cited last week’s match against Chicken Inn as a good example, when they completely dominated the game and created a handful of chances which they wasted, resulting in a nil-all draw. It was the same story when they faced Simba Bhora three weeks ago in a game they also completely dominated and created the better chances. They paid dearly for their inefficiency when Walter Musona netted a smash and grab winner. ""I'm happy with the way we are creating chances, but not happy with our finishing,"" Mangombe said. ""Against Chicken Inn, we dominated and created plenty of chances. Putting the ball into the back of the net still remains a problem. This week, we have been training on our finishing, and hopefully, we will see an improvement against Herentals."" The former Yadah coach is worried about the potential threat posed by bogey side Herentals. Previous clashes between the two city rivals have been fought tightly, and Mangombe believes it will be no different this time around. ""When we play against Herentals, they give it their all, always. They treat this as a proper derby, they always want to win this match. It's not just Herentals alone, every player is motivated when they face Dynamos. At the same time they want to prove that they are good players. We are prepared for that. We need to be mentally sharp because we know they (Herentals) will do everything in order to beat us,"" Mangombe said. Dynamos welcome back into the team vice captain Emmanuel Jalai who missed the trip to Bulawayo due to suspension. The bad news is that Frank Makarati and Tanaka Shandirwa, who also missed last week's game due to injuries, are yet to recover. Winger Issa Sadiki has been added on to the injury list. Mangombe is desperate to win against Herentals for two significant reasons. First, to keep pace with the leading teams, and secondly, cement his position as the head of the technical team. Mangombe's performance is reviewed after every five games, thus the Herentals game is a start of a new cycle of the matches. DeMbare currently lie in 12th position on the log standings with 11 points, eight behind log leaders Highlanders. Mangombe's could however, be awarded three points from their abandoned match against Chegutu Pirates. Herentals have also had a horrible start too, and last week's 1-0 win over Yadah was only their second victory in nine matches. Crucially, the victory moved them out of the relegation zone into 14th position with 10 points. Matchday 11 fixtures  Today: GreenFuel v Zpc Kariba (GreenFuel), Yadah v Caps United (Rufaro), Bulawayo Chiefs v Chicken Inn (Luveve), Simba Bhora v Ngezi Platinum Stars (Wadzanai). Tomorrow: Manica Diamonds v Bikita Minerals (Sakubva), Highlanders v Fc Platinum (Barbourfields), Hwange v Arenel Movers (Colliery), Dynamos v Herentals (Rufaro), TelOne v Chegutu Pirates (Bata). "

The Bulawayo giants fired blanks last week when they drew to Arenel Movers in a match that ended goalless. But they remained on top of the log with 19 points from 10 games. They are tied with Manica Diamonds, whose goal difference is inferior. Meanwhile, FC Platinum beat Green Fuel in their last match, ending a rather nightmarish spell in April. They are now third on the standings after being awarded maximum points from the abandoned match against Caps United. A win could see FC Platinum taking pole position depending on how Manica Diamonds fare against Bikita Minerals on the same day. Mapeza is optimistic ahead of the match and has chosen not to pay attention to how Highlanders have performed since the return of Zambian coach Kelvin Kaindu. ""We still have the same players who were out against Green Fuel sidelined. They have not yet recovered so they are out. But everyone else is fine,” said Mapeza ""Highlanders have a very good coach. They have been doing very well of late. They haven't won their last games, which were derbies. ""It's a normal phase in football. Everyone goes through it in football. They are a quality team and we know the danger especially when playing at Barbourfields. ""What is important for us is to make sure that we get everything right in all the phases of the game. ""Every time we get a positive result, it's a massive boost for us despite the scoreline. We needed the last match's win because the last four weeks were terrible for us,"" Mapeza added. "

                     Mohadi shamed by stadia ban
                    ","VICE-PRESIDENT Kembo Mohadi has admitted that government is embarrassed by the country's failure to host international football matches due to the country’s sub-standard facilities. Mohadi came face to face to with the level of decay of the local sporting facilities when he toured the National Sports Stadium, Magamba Hockey Stadium and Rufaro Stadium yesterday. He was accompanied by acting Sports minister Jenfan Muswere and deputy Emily Jesaya on a mission to assess progress on the rehabilitation of some of the facilities. Speaking after the tour, Mohadi said he felt ashamed and that the government is equally embarrassed by how sporting facilities have deteriorated to the extent that all stadiums have been condemned to host international matches. “Zimbabwe as one of the most elite nations, to be disqualified [from hosting international matches] and find that other countries that are least elite qualify, is an egg on our face,” Mohadi said. “I remember at one time these sporting facilities were so good that we even managed to host the All-Africa Games in 1995.” In that year, the government managed to renovate Rufaro Stadium, as well as building Magamba Hockey Stadium, Khumalo Hockey Stadium and the Aquatic Complex in Chitungwiza. Only the Khumalo Hockey stadium in Bulawayo is still fit for purpose. “Together with the councils and the central government we need to see to it that we spruce up our sporting facilities to a standard whereby we qualify to host Caf and Fifa tournaments. Sport is not just a recreational thing, it's a discipline and a career. There are many people [who] you know [who] have taken sport as a career and have done very well in their lives. We need to have state-of-the-art sporting facilities in this country because we can actually do so. I'm saying so because in 1995 when we won the bid to host the All Africa Games, sporting facilities were done within a very short space of time. It is sort of embarrassing to learn that we are being disqualified because we don't have plastic bucket seats, something that doesn't cost quite a lot. We have to end this embarrassment,” Mohadi said. Zimbabwe has not had a Caf-certified stadium since 2019 when the National Sports Stadium was condemned for failing to meet international standards. At the time, Caf said a number of areas of the stadium need to be looked into, including the installation of bucket seats, modern electronic turnstiles and automated systems, and the setting up of a functional venue operations centre with a good view of the stadium, equipped with CCTV monitors for security purposes. Caf also demanded the refurbishment of changing rooms and the upgrading of the B Arena in line with Caf training field infrastructure requirements. But five years on, very little has been done by the government to renovate the stadium to meet the required standards. In fact, the stadium has deteriorated further and is now closed for use by local clubs. Consequently, Zimbabwe are playing their international home matches in foreign lands. The country used Huye Stadium in Rwanda to host Nigeria in their 2026 World Cup qualifier in November. Next month, the Warriors will host Lesotho in the same qualifiers at Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg on June 7. This is despite assurances by Sports Minister Kirsty Coventry early this year that renovation works at the National Sports Stadium will be fast-tracked for it to be ready for the June qualifier. Mohadi said he has taken it upon himself to push for the facilities to be resuscitated. “We have taken it upon ourselves that we need to correct that. I want to thank the City of Harare through His Worship the Mayor Councillor Jacob Mafume for the strides that they have taken to spruce and mordenise Rufaro Stadium. They have managed to meet some of the requirements that are required of by Caf and Fifa. He was informing me that Rufaro is now hosting league matches, which is good music to my ears. Together, the council and the central government have got to do it. We have to create sporting facilities that meet the international standards. It will be good for us and maybe happy moments for us when we would eventually host international tournaments on our soil. “It's not much that needs to be done, the scope of works that have been availed to me for both the National Sports Stadium and Rufaro are not insurmountable,” Mohadi added. During the tour, Mohadi was informed by Sports ministry officials that work to renovate the National Sports Stadium could start in October when the bucket seats, imported from China, are expected to arrive in the country. The officials said the turnstiles and CCTV monitors are already in the country.   "

                    ","ZIMBABWE T20I captain, Sikandar Raza, who is currently going through a lean spell in the ongoing series against Bangladesh, has admitted that he and other senior batsmen have let the team down. Raza, who for long has literally been carrying the team on his shoulders is yet to make an impression in the series having so far recorded scores of zero, three and one in the three matches the Chevrons have played and lost. Bangladesh have raced to a 3-0 lead and bagging the series in the process with two games to spare. The closest the Chevrons came to winning a match was in the third T20I when they went down by nine runs. Hosts Bangladesh scored 165/5 after being put to bat first, while the visitors  perished on 156/9 at the end of their 20 overs. Raza, the mercurial Chevrons skipper who made it into the ICC Men's global T20I squad for 2023, reflected on his performance so far in the series and the bearing it has had on the team's performance. “We did fight well, but the fact is that the top five including myself haven't done well. We needed to support (Tadiwanashe) Marumani and we could have chased it down,” Raza said. “A lot of runs have come from the lower order, they've been working hard, but the results need to come.” Runs for Zimbabwe in this series have been coming from such young players as Clive Madande, Wellington Masakadza, Jonathan Campbell, Brian Bennett and Faraz Akram. This is a cause for concern for Raza and interim coach Stuart Matsikenyeri given that had at least two of the senior players chipped in at any given stage results could have been different. “We have several youngsters whom we're grooming, it's not easy for them to come to Bangladesh and do well,” noted Raza. “Mistakes have happened, but I'm okay with them. Those three youngsters put up their hands (Akram, Campbell and Marumani), and they brought us close and I thought we might win at one point. They've been a lot of positives and I'm really happy for them, but it's the top order which needs to deliver for us.” The top order has also been on top of coach Matsikenyeri’s list of worries and Raza would not have said it any better as the leader of the pack. “A little bit better, but largely still disappointing because we haven't played to the standard that we expect ourselves to. We still know that if we reach anywhere close to our standard, performance wise, that way we will be competitive and will give ourselves an opportunity to win the game,” Matsikenyeri said. “All the shortcomings, the midfields, dropped catches, loose deliveries all need cleaning up. But, it is mainly obviously the top order batting or maybe call it the core of the batting that we need to make more meaningful contributions so that we put ourselves in positions of winning games.” Zimbabwe are in Mirpur this morning for the fourth T20I against the hosts.   "

The Bulawayo giants fired blanks last Sunday when they were held to a goalless draw by new boys Arenel Movers in a match the Zambian gaffer believes Highlanders should have won. Bosso forwards have been lethargic of late with the league’s leading goal scorer Lynoth Chikuhwa (on five goals) having last scored when Highlanders fell 2-1 to Chicken Inn at Barbourfields (BF) three weeks ago. He struggled in the 2-0 victory over Caps United in which defender Andrew Mbeba and midfielder Mckinnon Mushore scored. Brighton Ncube’s last goal was in the 2-2 draw to Herentals in Harare two weeks ago with the other goal coming from youthful defender Mvelo Khoza. Chikuhwa and Ncube (on four goals) started the season with a bang, but their form has slumped. Kaindu is aware of the threat that FC Platinum poses, but said they were working on their finishing ahead of the Sunday clash. “Most teams have tried to prevent us from scoring and we are happy that in the last games that we have played, it is only one (against Arenel) that we have not managed to get any goal. We are still working on our finishing in offensiveness when we have the ball. We are playing FC Platinum, a formidable side and they have a good coach who can influence the result of the game at any given time. We know the pedigree that FC Platinum have, the style of play that they want to display and we hope that it is going to be entertaining to all our fans,” Kaindu said. Young attacking midfielder Prince Ndlovu is believed to be injured, while midfielder Melikhaya Ncube is suspended as he sits on three yellow cards. Kaindu spoke of an injured player due for a late fitness test, but withheld his name. “Our preparations for the coming fixture on Sunday against FC Platinum are, so far so good. The only problem that we have is a player who will be missing out because of suspension and maybe one player who still has to be attended to in terms of being fit to play. He is yet to see the doctor, but I cannot disclose his name for now,” Kaindu said. He added: “Melikhaya has been instrumental in all the games that he played. He has been consistent and he has played all the games without being substituted.” "

                    ","THERE is a palpable weight of expectation on the local golfers to provide the first winner of Zimbabwe Open when the competition tees off at Royal Harare Golf Club in Harare this morning. The FBC Zimbabwe Open championship, which has attracted 144 golfers from across the globe, is set to conclude on Sunday. All of the country’s top golfers, including the Vincent siblings Scott and Kieran, Robson Chinhoi, Ben Follett-Smith and Stuart Krog, among others are taking part in the flagship annual golf competition. There are also no less than seven former champions competing in the FBC Holding Group-sponsored event, among them defending champion Neil Schietekat, two time winner Jbe’ Kruger and 2001 winner Darren Fichardt among others. Krog, who has been playing on the Sunshine Tour for the past year believes Zimbabwe has the best chance of providing a winner of the tournament for the first time since 2000 when legend Mark McNulty bagged it at the same venue. “I think this is the best chance that we have had (to win it), but golf is golf, expectation may lead to disappointment. But I think all the Zimbabwe golfers are very comfortable in their skin and they want to put on a show and so hopefully we can keep the trophy at home,” he told NewsDay Sport yesterday. “I am ready. It’s just another week, this is a home Open, so you want to do well at home, but at the end of the day if I do everything good with my preparation then I get my best shot of succeeding during the week. I feel like I am in a good spot right now and I am excited to play this week,” the 28-year-old golfer said. The event launched on Sunday with a pre-qualifier event saw ProAm competition being held in the past two days as a precursor to the main Championship. Tournament director Michael Mahachi is happy with preparations for the Championship tee off. “I must say we are ready to get going tomorrow when the championship tees off early in the morning. All the players who entered the tournament have registered which means we don’t have any withdrawals of players we expected to make the strong field that we have this year,” he said. “A total of 144 players will tee off tomorrow and there will be a cut after 36 holes that will be 60 professional players and those tied will the proceed to the third and fourth round. “This event continues to grow not just the way we see it, but from the feedback that we get from our sponsors and partners as well the players. We have seen it has become one of the favourites on the Sunshine Tour. “This is evidenced by what the players have said during surveys that have been conducted by the Sunshine Tour. They feel it’s one of the most special events they play every year. They talk about the organisation of the event and the great golf course and above all the hospitality that they get from the Zimbabweans, so we are very proud of ourselves.” Scott Vincent will be making a second appearance at the event since his debut as a professional in 2016 when he was the best placed Zimbabwean following an impressive final round 7-under-65 which saw him tie for fourth place. Last year, the younger of the two siblings, Kieran Vincent took part in the FBC Zimbabwe Open and tied for sixth place on 3-under par 285 after four rounds of golf. Zimbabwe golf legend Nick Price, Tony Johnstone and Mark McNulty are the only local professionals to have won the tournament. Other local-based players who have done well so far are David Amm who won the Lowveld ProAm at the beginning of March before Visitor Mapwanya held his nerve to beat Brian Gondo in the National Aids Council HIV and Cancer Prevention Drive ProAm at Royal Harare two weeks later.

                     PSL comes down hard on Caps, Chitembwe
                    ","THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) has descended heavily on Caps United after handing the Harare giants a hefty fine for causing the abandonment of their league match against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium earlier this season. The PSL disciplinary committee slapped a US$5 000 fine on the Green Machine for their fans' hooliganism, while club coach Lloyd Chitembwe was also fined US$400 for his post-match outburst in which he branded the match officials “stupid”. FC Platinum, who were leading the match 1-0 when the match was called off due to crowd trouble, have been handed the game on a 3-0 forfeiture scoreline. Consequently, the Zvishavane side moves into third position on the log standings with 18 points, one behind joint leaders Highlanders and Manica Diamonds after 10 rounds of matches, while Caps United remain on seventh position with 13 points, although their goal difference section on the log table has taken a significant knock. In a statement yesterday, the PSL said Caps United had been found guilty of causing the abandonment of the match and will pay US$4 500 plus the costs of the hearing. ""The club was found guilty of causing the abandonment of the match and fined a sum of US$5 000, US$500 of which is suspended on condition that the club is not convicted of a similar offense. The effective fine of US$4 500 together with the costs of the hearing is to be paid by May 27, 2024. Additionally, the match has been forfeited and awarded to FC Platinum on a 3-nil scoreline. Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe was also found guilty of making statements that bring the league into disrepute and dined US$400."" The match was abandoned around 85th minutes after the away fans invaded the pitch in protest over a Ralph Kawondera disallowed goal. The home side had taken a first half lead through Juan Mutudza before the former FC Platinum midfielder thought he had secured a point for a his side late on, but his effort was disallowed by match officials for an offside, much to the disgust of the Caps United fans who decided to take matters into their hands. The PSL disciplinary committee is also expected to make a judgement in another abandoned match between Dynamos and Chegutu Pirates at Baobab Stadium last month. The match was called off after Chegutu Pirates supporters protested the awarding of a late Dynamos goal by Emmanuel Paga which they argued did not cross the goal line. Both teams were asked by the league bosses to submit reports of what transpired on the ill-fated day. "

                    ","ZIMBABWE senior men's cricket team interim coach Stuart Matsikenyeri says his team will treat their T20I dead rubber matches against Bangladesh seriously as they seek to win and improve the team's rankings. The Chevrons are trailing 3-0 to their hosts in the T20I series ahead of the fourth and final matches tomorrow and Sunday, respectively. Zimbabwe came agonisingly close to win the third match on Tuesday after an improved performance, but fell short to give Bangladesh an unassailable 3-nil lead. Matsikenyeri admitted his charges have not been up to the required standards in this tour, and has challenged his players to salvage their pride and ranking points from the remaining two matches. Zimbabwe are currently ranked number 13 in T20I rankings behind Ireland and Scotland who are number 11 and 12, respectively, while Afghanistan sits on 10th position. India is on number one, followed by Australia and England. ""Ranking points are important, so whichever way selection for the next matches goes, we have to keep pushing for some wins before we leave here,"" Matsikenyeri told NewsDay Sport. The Chevrons, buoyed by some impressive bowling display from pace bowler Blessing Muzarabani, came close to revive the series on Tuesday in the third T20I match. The towering seamer picked three wickets for 14 from four overs. This was after Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza elected to bowl first, with the hosts reaching 165/5 in their allotted overs. Raza and Faraz Akram picked a wicket apiece before the latter’s late onslaught with the bat, a 19-ball 34. Opener Tadiwanashe Marumani’s 31 off 26 and Jonathan Campbell’s 10-ball 21 saw the visitors fall by just nine runs. Zimbabwe ran out of balls at 156/9. “I thought we had a good chance at half way. The target was definitely not out of reach. Unfortunately, we just didn’t find momentum in the middle period of our batting, losing our experienced batters early didn’t help,” Matsikenyeri said. “But it was pleasing to see that we still put our best foot forward and did our best to chase it down with our lower order who struck the ball pretty well. Massive positive with the ball from Muzarabani, thought he bowled really well, with good aggression and control. Raza, who is struggling for form with the bat in Bangladesh, conceded he needed to up his tempo. “We did fight well, but the fact is that the top five including myself haven’t done well. We needed to support Marumani and we could have chased it down. A lot of runs have come from the lower order, they have been working hard, but the results need to come,” said Raza after the match. “We have several youngsters whom we are grooming, it’s not easy for them to come to Bangladesh and do well. Mistakes have happened, but I’m okay with them. Those three youngsters put up their hands (Akram, Campbell and Marumani), and they brought us close and I thought we might at one point in time. There have been a lot of positives and I’m really happy for them, but it’s the top order which needs to deliver for us.” "

                    ","TOP Zimbabwean golfer Robson Chinhoi is confident of causing an upset and win the FBC Zimbabwe Open championship which tees off at Royal Harare Golf Club tomorrow morning. Chinhoi, who has been doing well on the Sunshine Tour in the past 12 months is one of the country's high profile golfers who will be flying the country’s flag at the Zim Open. Others include the Vincent siblings Scott and Kieran as well Ben Follett-Smith and Stuart Krog who are playing golf outside the country. The Zimbabwe Open has been dominated by South Africans who have won all the editions since the reintroduction of the event in 2010. The golfer who turns 33 today arrived in the country on Monday evening after competing at the Waterfall City TC by Attacq where he finished in a two-way tie 26th last weekend.  “It is always good to be home. The target for this year is I think everyone is always thinking about winning. Nobody is playing to just make the cut, so we are playing to win. I am just looking to play well and be myself and see what happens,” he said soon after his arrival. Chinhoi bagged the biggest win of his career in May last year when he won the Sunshine Tour-sanctioned Zanaco Masters in Zambia. At least 33 golfers out of the 144 taking part in Zimbabwe’s premier golf event will compete under the Zimbabwe flag among them top junior players such as Braydon Amm (16), Keegan Shutt (17) and Tanaka Chatora (18). The official opening of the 2024 FBC Zimbabwe Open was held at Royal Harare where club captain Tendayi Gwatiringa handed the 126-year-old golf facility to the Zimbabwe Open Committee. Zimbabwe Open Committee chairperson Livingston Gwata received the club flag from Gwatiringa. Gwata expressed gratitude to the sponsors who have made the staging of the country's flagship event possible. “We want to express our special gratitude to the title sponsors FBC Holdings Limited for the third year in succession. Thank You Trynos Kufazvineyi and your team for making this happen. We have an array of other sponsors who continue to be with us. “It does promise to be an exciting tournament. It is difficult times in terms of the economy and for our sponsors to come out in full force and do what they have done we, as the Zim Open Committee, are most grateful,” he said. The 2024 edition of the Zim Open will see at least seven former winners, including defending champion Neil Schietekat, two-time champion Jbe' Kruger, Albert Venter, JC Ritchie, Lyle Rowe, Jean Hugo and Darren Fichardt taking part.

                    ","NGEZI Platinum Stars' nervy 1-0 victory over Bulawayo Chiefs on Saturday ended a five match winless streak for the defending champions and coach Takesure Chiragwi hopes it will be the catalyst to turn around their league fortunes. Madamburo, who had lost once and drew four in their previous five matches, got back on track with a Takunda Benhura first half goal. The win helped ease some pressure on Chiragwi who is under the microscope after his team's underwhelming start to the season. “I hope with this win, the heavens have smiled on us to go on a good winning run,” a relieved Chiragwi said. “I believe this could be the start of a winning phase for us. I can feel it because we are coming from a tough phase. I am just hoping that the difficult phase is behind us and we can start winning games again. We should start to enjoy the phase of winning, which is important for the team.” The club’s management have publicly backed Chiragwi and he is appreciative. “It is very important for me. As the head coach of the team, I am happy to know that my bosses are always there for me. They understand that we are going through a bad phase. They also know that being defending champions is not easy because every team wants to beat us. I really appreciate their support and I am happy because they always give us an umbrella that protect us from any storm. They have been very supportive in everything. This is a great club, to be honest, and we are happy with our management because when the situation is like this, it is also difficult for them but they understand what we are going through.” Ngezi Platinum’s major problem this season has been their porous defence which has let in nine goals so far against the eight that they have scored. They have managed to keep five clean sheets in their first 10 games of the season. Chiragwi is demanding his defence, which was the team’s pillar of strength last season, to pull up their socks. “If you score goals and then you do not defend well, you do not win matches. The basic football language is to make sure that you concentrate the whole 90 minutes. If you score, defend well, you win. But if you open up at the back and concede easily, then you are likely to lose or draw. We are working on it ... that once we get goals, we do not have to concede nomatter how difficult the situation might be. We have to show resistance at the back,” he added. "

                     Matsikenyeri demands better from batters
                    ","ZIMBABWE senior men's cricket team interim coach Stuart Matsikenyeri has demanded an improved performance from the top order batsmen if the team is to stay alive in the ongoing T20I series against hosts Bangladesh. The Chevrons found themselves two matches down following eight-wicket and six-wicket loses in their first and second T20 Internationals. In both matches the Achilles hill has been the top order batting that has not been able to put enough runs on the board with the senior players struggling the most. Clive Madande and Wellington Masakadza fought hard with the bat in the series opener, scoring 43 and 34 runs, respectively, to give their bowlers some decent score to defend after the top crumbled early, leaving the visitors on 36/4 in the power play. This was after Joylord Gumbie scored 17, Craig Ervine nought, Brian Bennett 16, with veterans Sean Williams and Craig Ervine both failing to get off the mark. The second match saw youngsters Jonathan Campbell and Brian Bennett taking the fight to their hosts with unbeaten on debut on 45 and 44, respectively, as the team laboured to 138/7 in 20 overs. In the Sunday match, Ervine managed 13 after Tadiwanashe Marumani fell for two runs with Gumbie chewing 30 balls for his 17. Sikandar Raza only managed three, while Clive Madande fell for a duck. After the poor show by the established batters, Matsikenyeri wants to see a better display. “It was a little bit better (on Sunday) but largely still disappointing because we have not played to the standard that we expect ourselves. We still know that if we reach anywhere close to our standard, performance wise, that way we will be competitive and will give ourselves an opportunity to win the game,” Matsikenyeri told NewsDay Sport. “All the shortcomings, the midfields, dropped catches, loose deliveries all need cleaning up. But, it is obviously the top order batting or maybe call it the core of the batting that we need to make more meaningful contributions so that we can stay alive in the series."" The former Zimbabwe batsman was impressed by Campbell and Bennett’s batting tipping them to go far with consistent performances. “If anything, that has been the positive of the tour so far. We have had some of our not so experienced and younger players coming out and putting their best foot forward finding answers and playing positively. Brian and Jonathan were those two for us yesterday (Sunday) they were very good in their approach, they were very positive. They conducted themselves exactly the way we trained when we were preparing for this trip,” he added. “So, it was good to see and you know as long as they keep working and they stay as confident they will play well for Zimbabwe in the future like they did yesterday (Sunday).” Bowling all-rounder Masakadza is recuperating well and might be in line for selection for the third T20I  today. “So far Wellington has done okay. He took that knock on the head in the first game, but he sat out yesterday (Sunday), we did everything that was asked of him to help him with getting better. He has been looking good so, obviously we are taking it by the hour,” said Matsikenyeri. “We see how he is in the morning and then we make a call from there. But, so far the medical team is happy that he is coming through okay, hopefully he continues to improve.” Zimbabwe will play two more T20I matches against Bangladesh after today. "

The stalemate meant that the Bulawayo giants now have the same number of points as Manica Diamonds who defeated ZPC Kariba at Nyamhunga on Saturday. Highlanders coach Kelvin Kaindu said the draw felt like a defeat. “It’s not even a point gained. I would say we dropped three points today. Out of all the games that we have drawn, I feel this is a game that we should have won. In terms of playing our local teams, we have drawn twice and lost once and I think there is a lot of complacency in our team. We have also noticed that every team that we draw with is celebrating. If you don’t score early against these teams you get frustrated. They will be going down and delaying like what that keeper was doing,” Kaindu said. Arenel coach Farai Tawachera was happy with a draw which they dedicated to their vice-chairman Bheka “Mahii” Sibanda, who collapsed and died in a Bulawayo shop on Saturday morning. “I am happy with the point. It’s not easy to play Highlanders. One needs to bring a lot of thinking into the game. We just said let them play and we play. But when we get the ball, let’s hit them where it matters most. We could have buried them in the first half. We were a bit hesitant in the final third. But it’s normal, we are a new team trying to work our combinations. It takes time,” Tawachera said. Arenel showed early in the game that they were not intent on just sitting to protect a point with forays of their own. Highlanders’ shot-stopper Raphael Pitisi cut out a potentially dangerous cross by Arenel’s Kudzaishe Dzingwe in the 12th minute. A blunder by left-back Archford Faira and central defender Peter Muduhwa inside their penalty area almost cost Highlanders in the 17th minute, but Pitisi once again came to the rescue from another Dzingwe effort. Brighton Ncube, for Highlanders, connected an Andrew Mbeba freekick in the 38th minute, but Arenel goalkeeper Aaron Ngwenya made a brilliant save. Content with a draw, Arenel started employing time-wasting antics going into the second half with no meaningful attack from either side. Ngwenya, the culprit in time-wasting was cautioned by referee Owen Manenda and Tawachera had no kind words for the goalkeeper after the match. Highlanders skipper Muduhwa tried to lead by example, advanced upfront and caused anxious moments for Arenel Movers in the second half, but the goals would not come.

Quick fire goals early in the contest, first from Manondo, who connected a Junior Bunjira cross at the back post and a Hastings Chapusha rising shot following a corner kick three minutes later, put the Green Machine on their way to a comfortable win. Manondo put the Lloyd Chitembwe-coached side out of sight with a 41st minute headed goal, connecting a perfect Eric Manokore cross from the right as the Green Machine bounced back from their loss away to Highlanders last week. Bottom placed Hwange were in shambles defensively in this one-sided contest in the first half, but still managed to cause a brief scare towards the break when Pritchard Mphelele forced a good save by Caps goalkeeper Tonderai Mateyaunga. The first half lead allowed Caps United to play with a lot of freedom in the second stanza as they passed the ball around nicely with new boy Kingsley Mureremba, given his first start since he joined from relegated Cranborne Bullets, a joy to watch. Manondo could have registered a hat trick early in the second half when he rose unmarked a few metres out, but his thumping header went straight into the hands of Hwange keeper Bhekimpilo Ncube. That proved to be the only meaningful chance in the uneventful second half. The three points moved Caps United into seventh position with 13 points, six behind log leaders Highlanders after 10 rounds of matches. The defeat was Hwange’s sixth of the season as the struggling side remained bottom of the standings with six points from a possible 30. Their coach Nation Dube, who is under pressure after the horrible start to their season, admitted things are not well. “We just failed to defend the crosses into the box and the opponent utilised their chances,” Dube said. “We go back to the drawing board and see how we can improve on our defending because we are creating chance, but also failing to convert them. We are so porous at the back. I'm worried because if we can go six games without a win, as a coach you become worried.” Chitembwe was happy with his team's response following the defeat to Highlanders last week. “It was a good game, and we are happy. We scored more and did a very good job in terms of defending. But I think we need to do more, be more consistent.” Commenting on Manondo's performance, he said: “His performance was good.

                    ","PORTUGUESE national Baltemar Brito has unfinished business with the Warriors which has prompted him to apply for the vacant Zimbabwe senior men’s national football team’s coaching job. The Zifa normalisation committee has invited applications for the job for the second time having previously appointed Brito only on interim basis for the two 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers against Nigeria and Rwanda last year. An impeccable source within the leadership of local football confirmed that the former Warriors and Highlanders’ gaffer had applied for the job. “He [Brito] applied. He wants to come back [to Zimbabwe]. I think he has more interest in Zimbabwe than the recent possibility of him joining the Cameroon national team where he was invited for interviews. He has always had his mind on Zimbabwe to finish the job that he started,” the source said. During the week, Zifa flighted a fresh advertisement for the Warriors job as the senior men’s team will be in South Africa in June to take on Lesotho and Bafana Bafana at Orlando Stadium  and Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein at home and away, respectively. Zimbabwe has no stadium  fit to host a competitive international match. In the advert, Zifa stated that the duties of the coach with a Caf Pro or Caf “A” license would be to: “Lead the senior men’s national team and direct the programme and preparations of the teams for various tournaments, including the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers and Cosafa tournaments.” It said the ideal candidate must have extensive international football knowledge and experience, particularly at the senior national team level and prior experience coaching an African national team is an added advantage. The ideal candidate must have the ability to foster a competitive and successful team and should have strong educational background with a clear coaching methodology. Familiarity with the role of sports science in preparing players for international competitions is also one of the attributes. Local coaches have also been urged to apply. After 18 months in the wilderness due to a Fifa ban following government interference, Zimbabwe returned to international football in July last year. Brito, then Highlanders’ coach, was in September appointed as Warriors’ interim coach and took charge of the Group C 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers in Rwanda in November. The Warriors played a home match against Nigeria at Huye Stadium and it ended one-all having played a goalless draw against Rwanda days earlier. They have picked up two points in Group C and Brito is looking forward to resume Warriors’ hunt for World Cup qualification. The Portuguese gaffer’s contract with Zifa ended on December 31 and back then, the national football governing body said they could not continue with Brito because they could not afford him. FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza bounced back as Warriors’ coach on an interim basis and recently took charge in a four-nation tournament in Malawi. "

After the loss to Yadah, the Gamecocks (15 points) were dislodged from the second spot by on-fire Manica Diamonds (16 points) and they dropped further down to position four as Bulawayo Chiefs (15 points) rose on the log standings after beating Chegutu Pirates. Against Dynamos today, Chicken Inn are without Danny “Deco” Phiri, who saw red against The Miracle Boys and Brighton Makopa is being monitored after an injury in the last game. Coach Joey Antipas is hoping for the best against Dynamos and bouncing back to winning ways. “It is a hell of a game. We are expecting fireworks. Dynamos are a good side and like Highlanders, are one of the biggest clubs in the country. We are looking forward to the game and hopeful that we bounce back. Deco is out and Makopa will have to pass a late fitness test and we will see what happens,” Antipas said. Dynamos are also missing key players through injury or suspension. Skipper Frank Makarati, his deputy Emmanuel Jalai and Tanaka Shandirwa will miss the match. Makarati and Shandirwa are out injured while Jalai is suspended. Coach Genesis Mangombe needs an outright win against Chicken Inn to keep his job safe at the Harare giants. Tomorrow log leaders Highlanders have a tough one against city neighbours Arenel Movers. Bosso coach Kelvin Kaindu is spoilt for choice as his squad has a clean bill of health. Highlanders lead the pack with 18 points and look forward to stretching that lead. “These boys are quite familiar with each other; they interact with each other and that makes it very difficult. It’s a derby. We won last weekend but this is a different game, the other one is gone. We have done well against big teams and struggled against small teams. We struggled against Herentals and this is almost similar. We hope to make it. What we must do is guard against complacency,” Kaindu said. Highlanders are banking on Lynoth Chikuhwa, Brighton Ncube, Devine Mhindirira and the enterprising right-back Mvelo Khoza.

The “hosting” of the match in South Africa comes after government once again failed on its promise to rehabilitate the National Sports Stadium to meet the required Confederation of African Football (Caf) standards. Sports minister Kirsty Coventry last year assured the nation that the facility will be renovated and be ready in time for the Warriors to play the match against the Crocodiles on June 7 at the National Sports Stadium. However, not much work has been done to spruce up the deteriorating National Sports Stadium since then, leaving the Zifa normalisation committee with no option but to look for an alternative venue outside the country. The committee yesterday announced through their official social media channels that the Warriors will be at “home” against Lesotho at the Orlando Stadium. Kick off is 6pm. Four days later, Zimbabwe will face off with South Africa in an away match which has been scheduled for the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. The match will start at 9pm. The Warriors played their last home match against Nigeria in Rwanda where they had also faced the hosts in their first group match of the campaign. They managed to pick two points from the two clashes which were overseen by coach Baltemar Brito who has since left the job. Zifa are currently in search of the Warriors coach after advertising for the vacant position this week. Zimbabwe are second from the bottom in Group C of the 2026 Fifa World Cup African qualifiers which also has Benin. The National Sports Stadium was condemned in 2019 to host international matches. At the time, Caf said a number of areas of the stadium needed to be looked at for it to meet international standards. These included the installation of bucket seats made of unbreakable and non-inflammable material, modern electronic turnstiles and automated systems and the setting up of a functional venue operations centre with a good overview of the stadium equipped with CCTV monitors for security purposes. Caf also demanded the refurbishment of changing rooms and the upgrading of the B Arena in line with Caf training field infrastructure requirements. But three years on, very little has been done by the government to renovate the stadium to meet the Caf and Fifa standards despite Coventry’s assurances. In fact, the stadium has deteriorated further with the playing surface suffering from neglect. "

                     Bosso won’t have it easy: Arenel
                    ","ARENEL Movers coach Farai Tawachera has warned Highlanders that they face a tough fight for three points when the two sides clash in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. Tawachera said his boys are free of the pressure that suffocates big clubs when they face Bosso at BF. “It is a big game considering we are playing the big brother of the region. It is not going to be an easy game for us, neither is it going to be easy for them. We want to go there and express ourselves and exhibit what we can do. We are not under any pressure at all. There is nothing new about losing to Highlanders. We have seen big teams losing to Highlanders at BF and that makes us go out with no pressure but a free mind to express ourselves,” Tawachera said. He hoped his boys would have recovered from fatigue after travelling more than 3 000km by road to fulfil the last three matches. They are monitoring captain Zibusiso Dambo and striker Toto Banda who are recovering from injuries. Arenel lost their last two matches to Manica Diamonds and Green Fuel and sit on position 16 on the log table with eight points from one win and five draws. They have lost three matches going into the 10th game of the season. They face Highlanders who lead the championship race with 18 points from five wins, three draws and one defeat. After losing to Chicken Inn at BF and a draw to Herentals in Harare, Highlanders dispatched Caps United at home and are away to Arenel who have given big clubs a headache. Highlanders’ top striker Lynoth Chikuhwa has scored five goals to date and leads on the scorers’ charts. They will be looking up to him to provide the goals upfront. Highlanders have unearthed an enterprising right-back in teenager Mvelo Khoza, who is blessed with brilliant crosses. Khoza (18) impressed when he came in for an ineffective Brian Mlotshwa in Bosso’s loss to Chicken Inn and impressed. He has not looked back with coach Kelvin Kaindu putting his trust in the youthful defender. "

                     Lack of incentives sniffles Young Sables
                    ","THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) shot themselves in the foot due to their failure to provide incentives to the Young Sables side during the recently concluded Africa Rugby Barthes Trophy, which was won by Kenya. Hosting the continental cup brought about significant benefits and numerous advantages due to the passionate and enthusiastic support of local rugby fans. The Machinery Exchange Stadium at Harare Sports Club was packed to the rafters with fans  rallying behind their team in all three matches. Young Sables head coach Shaun de Souza, who missed out on a third straight Barthes Trophy victory, pointed out the lack of incentives as a major draw back. De Souza was aplopetic with anger. “We need to incentivise these boys. They have been working hard since November last year and this was their third attempt at the trophy, but they have nothing to show for it,” De Souza fumed. “Their parents have made sacrifices and these boys deserve recognition. Let us show some decency and give them the reward they deserve.” ZRU president Aaron Jani said the union wants to open opportunities for the players rather than pay them. “We are creating much better opportunities than the physical allowances they will get and blow in one day. So, now our focus is to put that money that would have gone to allowances and put into into preparations,” said Jani. “I am sure you have all seen that where the boys are staying, it is no less than a five-star hotel. All this is to set their mind to a professional level which is good for their future.” Everything went wrong for the Young Sables on Sunday. They gave away a 10-0 lead to lose the match 13-28, missing out on a Junior Rugby World Cup slot. Captain Benoni Nhekairo bemoaned that his troops  played to the gallery because of the colourful crowd that thronged the stadium. “I am not going to hide the fact that we gave Kenya the game. I feel like we were the better side but Kenya stuck together. They played as a family and they really put us on the back foot. They were better than us on the day,” Nhekairo said. “I think in the second half you could see players were now arguing, shouting at each other. I feel like boys were feeling the pressure and when little mistakes were made, we were going at each other’s [throat] instead of motivating each other; its part of the game. You learn as you go through.” "

                     Mthuli: The anti-devolution face
                    ","THE Zanu PF administration is against devolution and its actions of late confirm that its agreement to devolution clauses were just to get the new Constitution passed. The inclusive government of 2009 to 2013, after the disputed 2008 presidential polls, had a task to produce a new governing charter for Zimbabwe. It should be remembered that the process was nominally led by Parliament and was being driven by the Executive — the principals. Parliament, at the time, consisted of Zanu PF and two factions of the opposition MDC party — one led by Morgan Tsvangirai and the other by Welshman Ncube. The MDCs had a 10-seat majority in Parliament and for the first time Zanu PF experienced what it feels like to be in opposition or running a minority government. Minority governments are a phenomenon of the Westminster parliamentary system. Zanu PF was a minority in Parliament, but the President was from the party. It meant that the party had to build consensus on any policy decisions before they were announced. The constitutional review process was done in the spirit of the triumvirate, Zanu PF and the two MDC formations. It is clear and supported by multiple independent and reliable sources that the two big parties in the coalition — Zanu PF and Tsvangirai-led MDC were not keen on devolution. The Ncube-led MDC was the only one seriously concerned about devolution. There are a number of reasons why the parties took these positions. Zanu PF and Tsvangirai-led MDC had the potential to win a national election and thus form a strong central government. Meanwhile, the Ncube-led MDC was more of a provincial/regional political entity and its success could only be seen in the area they were likely to win, hence it needed some power to control the affairs in areas it won elections. It is now 11 years after Zanu PF won the 2013 elections, the first after the adoption of the new Constitution. However, it seems it has deliberately refused to implement the devolution clauses in the Constitution for selfish reasons. Firstly, Zanu PF is now a rural party and elections since 2000 have proved that. And secondly, urban areas are the engine of economic growth and allowing them to be controlled by the opposition will expose them to being poor administrators. Zanu PF is politically lucky that the main opposition — successor to Tsvangirai-led MDC — is also anti-devolution and has incompetent councils that have become champions of corruption and mismanagement. No one is seriously considering implementing devolution in the letter and spirit of the Constitution, except maybe David Coltart the Bulawayo mayor. And it is no coincidence he was a senior member of the Ncube-led MDC. It is clear that no one has the appetite for devolution among those in the political ring, except a few voices from civil society which deal with constitutionalism. Then we turn to this week’s event that seems to be the final nail into the devolution question. Finance minister Mthuli Ncube played another trick on the citizens or he was merely being used by the Executive to deliver the bad news. After Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting the following statement was issued: “Cabinet considered and approved the draft Zimbabwe Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfers Administrative Manual as presented by the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, Honourable Professor Mthuli Ncube,” before adding: “The nation is informed that Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfers from central to lower tiers of government are provided for under Section 301 of the Constitution. These transfers are meant to support the devolution of powers and responsibilities, with not less than 5% of national revenues raised in any financial year being allocated to provinces and local authorities.” Did Ncube deliberately misquote the section? Section 301(1) reads: “An Act of Parliament must provide for the equitable allocation of capital grants between provincial and metropolitan councils and local authorities; and any other allocations to provinces and local authorities, and any conditions on which those allocations may be made.” For the avoidance of doubt, a manual is not an Act of Parliament as envisaged in the Constitution. So, a question arises: Why is Ncube reluctant to bring to Parliament a Bill to address the issue of Section 301? A short answer to the question is: Zanu PF is not genuine on devolution and has never been. It still wants the all-powerful central government to be the only player in national and developmental politics. This is not the first time Ncube has dribbled Parliament. In the Finance Act of 2018, Ncube pulled the same trick. He amended the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act to abolish the National Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Board that controlled the Indigenisation Fund. The Fund was transferred to the Finance ministry. Ncube is playing the prince in President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s Cabinet. He is untouchable and can even effect changes to Acts of Parliament that do not fall under his purview. In other words, he is a super-minister. The time is now to stop this nonsense. Either the Zanu PF regime enacts a law as required by the Constitution on devolution or they can resort to their default position and repeal the sections of the Constitution which deal with devolution. They cannot continue to pick and choose which laws to obey. The onus is now on all progressive MPs and civil society to demand the full implementation of the 2013 Constitution, particularly on devolution. Zanu PF cannot continue to decide which areas to develop at its whim and the expected political fortunes they can derive from the areas they develop. Local people should determine their development as the Constitution dictates. Someone has to put a stop to this. Probably, starting with the MPs squaring up to Ncube to explain this hogwash. Or someone has to take him to the court and have him compelled to bring the Devolution Bill to Parliament. Or better still Parliament refusing to pass a vote for devolution funds until a Bill is passed on the same. "

                     Do more to end stigmatising of mental illness
                    ","EVERY year, Mental Health Awareness Month [May] has various mainstream media (news, social and entertainment) platitudinously state or promote the obvious: That society, collectively and as individuals, must open up its/our minds and encourage common dialogue towards far more fruitfully treating and preventing mental illness. Needless to say, everyone will agree, at least publicly, that stigmatising such illness and, by extension, its bearers should have ceased long ago. But then that is basically as far as it goes. Unlike with the loud and apparently quite effective voices lobbying the news, social and entertainment media against reinforcing stereotypes based on skin colour, sexuality, gender and even gender bending; there is no comparable influential protest voice against reinforcing stereotypes based on mental illness. I believe it is called the squeaky-wheel effect. When it comes to irresponsibly stereotyping and/or stigmatising people specifically living with schizophrenia, the 2008 box-office-hit movie The Dark Knight (as overall entertaining as it was) could be a textbook example. In one shameful scene, the glorified Batman character recklessly erroneously grumbles to the district attorney character Harvey Dent that the sinisterly-sneering clearly-conscience-lacking murderer he has handcuffed to a wheeled stretcher is “a paranoid schizophrenic — exactly the kind of mind that the Joker attracts”. I should add here, however, that I rather enjoyed and appreciated the relatively sympathetic theme on poverty and especially mental illness in the 2019 film Joker. Like The Dark Knight, the 2021 horror-flick old also stigmatises schizophrenia via a creepy character’s violent behaviour. We had entered the third millennium, yet a 4/4-star-rated Hollywood hit movie as well as a much more recent film, could still be readily found flagrantly demonising characters based on their mental illness. There was no societal or vocal condemnation. It seemed to not matter that people living with schizophrenia are generally more likely to harm themselves and/or be a victim of violence than they are to harm others. - Frank Sterle Jr "

                     Devotion: The heart of prayer
                    ","THE Father is not trying to make you cry ceaselessly, but He wants your heart. There is a simple Biblical interpretation system you can apply that you do not necessarily have to know Hebrew and Greek to understand what the Bible is saying. Praying without ceasing cannot mean when you start praying and break for eating or meeting or whatever you do on this earth, when you pray later you are restarting and need to remind God that you have come back. You were together in the meeting or the dining table. He never ever leaves you even if you feel you are alone. We need to think. Let us look at the Scripture. 1 Thessalonians 5:17 reads: “Pray without ceasing.” The verse is not saying when you start praying, don’t stop until the return of Christ. The Father is looking for those devoted to prayer. He wants us to be loyal. It is not so much of how long, but how sincere. You can pray the whole day or for 30 minutes. What matters at the end is how intimate were you. Let me help those who fast and pray for say 40 or 21 days. On the last day they fail to break the fast at sunset and eat around lunch. Some think they missed it and then brush aside the “incomplete” prayer and fasting. They feel unworthy, inadequate and condemned. But if you were sincere, God the Father heard you. It is the devil who wants to accuse you that you did not run the full length. Begin to thank God and praise Him for answered prayer. After all fasting is for our discipline, not for God to move or intervene, He is there with you whether fasting or not. A believer cannot ask the Father to intervene. From where? The Godhead, i.e. God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are in you. Let us look at Luke 18:1: “And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint.” The simplest explanation here is that don’t give up on prayer. Don’t faint, pick yourself up. Maybe you pray and fast for so long and you don’t get the desired result, please don’t curve in, give up or surrender. Please remember that God always gives us what we need. We don’t faint, but keep praying. Our prayers are from the heart not that we saw someone with the latest car and we change prayer points. That is carnality. In case you missed some of our teachings, New Testament prayers are basically praise and thanksgiving for what the Father has already given us in Christ. If you fix your eyes on Jesus, you will be victorious and more than conquerors. You may know fellow believers who get into cooperate prayer and spend the better part of the night and morning dealing with “principalities”. Why not spend the whole night and morning speaking to God in praise, worship and thanksgiving and He tells you that the “principality” has been dealt a blow and will never come near you. We shall reconcile why someone prays 10 minutes and all demons start crying and leave. Someone sits on a mountain from Friday and comes to church on Sunday and no one gets healing or “feel” the anointing. We have all along measured prayer quantitatively and not qualitatively. God the Father says don’t be like hypocrites who love to be seen, but rather have an intimate relationship with Him. Commit to prayer, be loyal and be devoted. When we deal with praying in the spirit, we shall see how some can pray from bedtime till morning. Let me quote one verse and I am out; Proverbs 4:23: “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen. Grace and peace be multiplied to you through knowledge. "

                     The whimsical world of work-life balance
                    ","AH, work-life balance, that elusive unicorn we all chase in the modern-day savannah of our lives. It’s like trying to find a comfortable position on an economy flight—seemingly impossible, yet endlessly pursued. We are told to lean in, but not too far lest we fall over. We are encouraged to hustle, yet reminded to stop and smell the roses—which, by the way, are now available in a convenient aerosol can for those too busy to find an actual garden. Let’s ponder the term “work-life balance” for a moment. It implies a scale, perfectly poised with work on one side and life on the other. But who can maintain such a precarious position? One unexpected email, and suddenly you are doing acrobatics to keep from toppling over. It’s less of a balance and more of a juggling act, where the balls are made of responsibilities, hobbies, and the occasional Netflix binge. Consider the modern office, a place where “open plan” has come to mean “no escape”. Your boss can now see you from across the room, making those covert social media checks all the more thrilling. And let’s not forget the symphony of typing, phone calls and the guy who eats celery like it’s his job. It’s a wonder we get anything done amid the cacophony of productivity. But then there is life—the part of the equation that is supposed to be all about relaxation and joy. Except, life has its own set of demands. Gym memberships that mock us with their unused potential, social events that require the energy we left at the office, and hobbies that have started to feel suspiciously like second jobs. We are in a constant state of toggling between tasks, trying to squeeze in a semblance of leisure between the cracks of our calendars. And yet, despite the chaos, there is something beautiful about the hustle. It’s in the small victories, like leaving work on time or turning off your phone for an hour of peace. It’s in the moments of connection, when we actually look up from our screens and engage with the world around us. It is in the realisation that balance is not about perfection; it’s about finding harmony in the discord. So, as we navigate the tightrope of our daily routines, let’s embrace the imbalance. Let’s celebrate the small wins and laugh at the absurdity of it all. Because at the end of the day, work-life balance is not a destination; it’s a journey—one that is best travelled with a sense of humour and the occasional detour into the ridiculous. And who knows? Maybe along the way, we will find that the unicorn is not so mythical after all. - Kumbirai Thierry Nhamo "

                     Youths should be on the forefront of climate change
                    ","THIS article was written out of the pain we went through as young people in rural Binga. I still remember we would travel 10 kilometres to fetch water from a river, in a village called Tinde. This happened at the expense of other things such as our education. When it rained ferociously we were at times not able to cross the river from school. We would wait until the water subsided and travelled home at night. This did not look problematic then. It was a normal life. The worst part was to discover late in life that all those things were slowly impacting other things such as our education and the quality of life in general. In the end it affected our results. Our life was affected by climate. We cannot avoid climate, it has cataclysmic impacts on our lives. In the face of a rapidly changing climate, the world stands at a pivotal juncture and leaders must take a firm stand. The decisions we make today will shape the planet for generations to come and our legislative house should have young people who are ready to lobby and advocate for laws on climate change. Among the most powerful agents of change in this global endeavour are the youths. We cannot stand and wait for other people to do it for us. Youths are not just the leaders of tomorrow, but also the catalysts of impactful change today. Understanding climate change It is up to the youths to investigate what climate change is so as to make relevant decisions. Generally, climate change refers to momentous changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over a period of time. While climate has changed throughout the Earth’s history, human activities have been driving unprecedented changes over the last century. These include the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial processes, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide into the earth’s atmosphere. Role of youths Young leaders possess the numbers, energy and creativity necessary for a sustainable future. First, education is important. Knowledge is power. By becoming well-informed about the science of climate change and its consequences, leaders can spread awareness and inspire action within their communities. Learning is important when change is happening. We cannot oppose the change that climate has brought. Opposing is just futile. So information on climate change is important. When we have the requisite education it becomes easy to innovate. Youths can use the leverage of technology to develop innovative solutions to reduce carbon footprints, such as applications that track energy consumption or platforms that facilitate the sharing of resources. However, in rural Binga we had no computers. To make matters worse we did not even know how a computer looked like. As we speak now, we have children who have never seen a computer, let alone touch it. Now we need to accelerate how rural children and leaders have access to these technologies. Young leaders have energy for activism: Young activists can mobilise the masses through campaigns, protests and social media, putting pressure on policymakers to enact environmentally friendly policies. Besides, we need Parliament to be flooded by young leaders who will speak and debate about climate change. We need to learn sustainable practices. Now there is talk of not only smart cities, but green cities. We must adopt sustainable lifestyles, such as reducing waste, conserving water and choosing renewable energy sources to significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. Politics shapes a lot of things. Without political will, we cannot win. In our next elections, the electorate must make sure we vote for people who are committed to climate change. By voting for leaders committed to fighting climate change and even running for office, young people can influence political agendas and steer legislative action towards sustainable development.. Parting point The battle against climate change is daunting, but it is not insurmountable. With youths at the helm, there is hope for a greener, cleaner and more sustainable future. Their actions today will echo through the ages, and it is imperative that they are equipped, encouraged and empowered to lead the way in this existential fight. This is a call to action for young individuals and leaders in Zimbabwe and the world in general to rise up and take ownership of the climate crisis. Their passion, combined with concerted efforts, can turn the tide against climate change and pave the way for a healthier planet. "

                     PVO Bill poisoned chalice.
                    ","The upcoming Public Hearings for the PVO Bill next week show that the government is determined to shut down civic space.  There is concern that if 10,000 organizations were to express interest in registering to support persons with disabilities, they may be restricted based solely on the fact that they have the same mandate.  This limitation goes against the fundamental principles of freedom of association and expression, which are essential for a thriving civil society. The PVO Bill aims to amend the Private Voluntary Organizations Act, which was first enacted in 1990 to regulate and monitor the operations of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Zimbabwe.  However, many civil society organizations (CSOs) have raised concerns about the proposed amendments, stating that they will severely restrict their ability to operate and fulfill their mandates. One of the main issues with the PVO Bill is the provision that limits the number of organizations that can register to support a particular cause.  This not only goes against the principles of inclusivity and diversity, but it also undermines the potential impact of collective action. If thousands of organizations are willing to work together towards a common goal, they should not be restricted based on their numbers. Furthermore, the Bill also dictates the structure and composition of PVOs, which should be determined by the organizations themselves. While some CSOs have a membership-based structure, others have a combination of trustees and members, and some operate solely through trustees.  These are all acceptable forms, as long as there are proper checks and balances in place to ensure good governance and accountability. By imposing a specific structure, the government is overstepping its boundaries and impeding on the autonomy of CSOs. However, the most alarming aspect of the PVO Bill is the provision that allows for the politicization of aid and funding for political parties. This not only goes against the role of CSOs as independent entities, but it also raises concerns about the potential misuse of funds and the alignment of aid with political agendas.  Many CSOs have voiced their opposition to this provision, stating that it could compromise their credibility and hinder their ability to effectively serve the communities they are meant to support. In addition to these concerns, there are also provisions in the Bill that could lead to the prosecution of individuals within PVOs for misnomers of their organizations.  This creates a culture of fear and could be used as a tool to target individuals who are working towards social and political change. It is important to note that organizations are legal persons and should be held accountable as such, rather than targeting individuals who may be acting on behalf of the organization. CSOs have consolidated their concerns and recommendations in their submissions to parliament, but it is worrying that the Bill is being fast-tracked without proper consideration for these concerns.  The media reports that the Bill will be passed as is, despite the numerous objections and recommendations from CSOs and other stakeholders. President Mnangagwa had initially intervened in the drafting of the PVO Bill, providing an opportunity for the government to reconsider some of the provisions. However, his concerns were not addressed, and the Bill remains unchanged.  This goes against the government's commitment to creating an enabling environment for civil society to thrive and fulfill their roles in society. If passed, the PVO Bill will not only restrict the operations of CSOs, but it will also have a chilling effect on civic space in Zimbabwe. It will limit the ability of organizations to advocate for the rights and needs of their constituents, and ultimately hinder the development and progress of the country. It is imperative that individuals and organizations come out in large numbers to the Public Hearings for the PVO Bill and voice their opposition to the proposed amendments.  This is a crucial opportunity for citizens to exercise their right to participate in the legislative process and make their voices heard. The more people who show up and speak out against the Bill, the stronger the message will be to the government that the proposed amendments are not acceptable. Additionally, it is important for citizens to understand the potential impact of the PVO Bill and how it could restrict the operations of civil society organizations and limit their ability to serve the communities they work in.  By attending the Public Hearings and rejecting the Bill, individuals will be standing up for the rights and needs of all Zimbabweans and promoting a more inclusive and democratic society. Let us come together and make our voices heard to protect the future of civic space in our country. "

                     ED must innovate to create a new economy
                    ","THE economic chaos and structural deformities are a boon to the creation of an alternative industry and commerce. New business has germinated, creating millions of jobs. The chaos has created immense opportunities that are being exploited to the full. Better than formal jobs in many instances. In this suffering some want the status quo to remain and they are in their millions. Attempting to formalise the economy and correct deformities will cause massive bleeding of these underground and alternative jobs. It requires strategic innovation to create more and better jobs in a formal economy. This is the challenge the government faces and seems blind on how to navigate it. The government is driven to formalise. Unfortunately, what in the so-called formal economy, job creation is a mirage and is not a desired strategic outcome for companies. Companies actually desire to destroy jobs rather than creating them. Automation, modernisation, artificial intelligence, robotics and other technologies are all driven at industry with hope of substituting the unionised labour force. It creates few other jobs, but in Zimbabwe we have a more serious and significant challenge. Our challenge is that our emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics higher education is very pale after its local architect, former minister Jonathan Moyo was discarded into the political dustbin, literally throwing away the bath water together with the baby. We have hordes of universities with more than 60% studying social sciences, arts and commercials. This will never create a new economy, the one that can deliver new jobs. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has to think smart on how to create a new economy to absorb the informal industries created by government’s absolute and disastrous failures. Millions are now employed in the parallel economy. Examples I give below are “industries” that will go extinct in a formal and working economy. The examples above are critical because the government has multiple challenges to innovate around job creation, diversifying the economy, reskilling, attracting new talent, diaspora migration, skills partnerships and re-education. The task this present government face is one that requires strategic innovation beyond extractive and primary industries of mining and agriculture. At present the government does not show passion at investing in that arena and have skills to drive a new country trajectory. It has to start with the mind. Yet here we are as a country still innovating around the familiar of agriculture and mining. The dilemma is keeping the current trajectory of an informal economy which is underground, whose income is undeclared and businesses are unregistered. We will continue to witness house construction, cars sales, private schools, bars, foreign trips and luxury purchases with no real income being realised by, for instance, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, National Social Security Authority, Zimbabwe Development Fund and municipalities. Public goods will be demanded from persons without a taxpayer number. The cities and towns will be burdened with residents who want the best but paying nothing for it. It does not seem we have the mind to innovate outside the familiar to destroy the prevailing economic chaos. We do not seem to have the skills, structures, systems and strategy to do so at Cabinet level. The alternative is equally problematic in that a formal economy which does not create jobs will pose existential threats to the ruling party. It can cause chaos. Idle minds will create a headache to the ruling class. Our government, Cabinet and ministries are still the same as in 1965 and for them to leapfrog in innovation to create formal jobs requires a new mindset. Most ministries are no longer fit for purpose. Then the question is who exactly in government is responsible for creating the new economy? Who co-ordinates several value creating ministries to ensure they get out of incremental innovation mode to disruptive and radical innovation? If, as a country, we have no clear answer and we are not creating jobs as a government, then we have failed. If we don’t have an environment to enable private enterprise to create jobs, then we have absolutely failed. If we destroy the old jobs without creating new jobs, then we are creating fertile ground for discontent to manifest. The big question is what is the government going to do with millions who are now self-employed due to government ineptitude? And, how will these people react if and when their “jobs” are taken away? The President must innovate outside the familiar to create a new formal economy with new jobs.   "

                    ","DISEASES like smallpox used to be inevitable. However, thanks to the life-saving power of vaccines and global collaboration, decades have passed since the last case. Health workers, community members and global leaders came together to permanently eradicate smallpox. Shortly after this historic feat, the world turned its attention to eradicating polio, another debilitating, preventable disease that attacks the nervous system and can cause lifelong paralysis or even death. Thanks to vaccines, health workers’ dedication and decades of global collaboration, wild polio cases have fallen by 99,9%, and 20 million people are walking today who would have otherwise been paralysed by the virus. Immunisation is one of our most successful and cost-effective public health interventions. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation, the routine vaccine schedule developed by the World Health Organisation in 1974, which is responsible for protecting many from the most common childhood viruses, including polio. New data released in The Lancet reveals that global immunisation efforts have saved an estimated 154 million lives over the past 50 years and have contributed to reducing infant deaths by more than 50% across Africa. However, making history is never easy. Despite decades of dedication and leadership from African Health ministers and other government leaders, challenges in reaching all children with polio vaccines remain. COVID-19-related disruptions to vaccine delivery fuelled the largest backslide in immunisation in three decades as health systems were overwhelmed and resources were diverted, leaving the most vulnerable without protection. The consequences of this backslide were severe. In 2022, Malawi, followed by Mozambique, reported the first cases of wild poliovirus in Africa in over five years, imported from abroad. Due to the drops in immunisation coverage, 15 countries — including Zimbabwe — in the region have been fighting to stop ongoing variant polio outbreaks since 2021. Strong routine immunisation coverage is critical to stopping polio. In eastern and southern Africa, 4,6 million children missed out on routine immunisation during the pandemic. For example, more than 977 000 children in Madagascar and 1,3 million children in Somalia did not receive a single vaccine dose between 2020 and 2022. Eradicating polio requires at least 95% vaccine coverage to stop the virus circulation and strong routine immunisation to prevent new infections. Despite efforts to boost immunisation rates, the same children continue to be missed. These “zero-dose” children, who have never been reached with any vaccines, often live in the hardest-to-reach areas, leaving them at risk of illness or even death from preventable diseases such as measles and polio. We have just returned from Madagascar, where there are more than one million “zero-dose” children between two and five years old. Data from the Public Health ministry shows that in 22 out of 23 regions of the country, less than 50% of children received their first dose of the polio vaccine at birth. We were heartened to hear from leaders and healthcare workers about how they are working to protect more children from infectious diseases. Under the guidance of the government, we can support their efforts to prioritise routine immunisation within the country’s primary healthcare system and urgently scale up efforts to close these extremely worrying immunity gaps. Much work remains to strengthen health systems in Madagascar and across the region so that we can protect every child against vaccine-preventable diseases. The needs are complex and daunting — but key to overcoming each and every challenge needs one single necessity: Political will. We are regularly reminded that “vaccines don’t save lives; vaccination saves lives”. For vaccination to happen, it is vital that leaders across the continent stay committed to investing in their health systems and vaccines, and publicly demonstrate their support for polio vaccination and wider immunisation. Continued engagement with community health workers and community leaders is also critical to achieving high rates of immunisation, even among the most vulnerable children. In October 2023, Zimbabwean health authorities declared officially the circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak a public health emergency following detection of the disease in environmental samples collected in Harare. The Health and Child Care ministry is co-ordinating the implementation of polio outbreak response activities including a nationwide polio vaccination campaign. The country has conducted two rounds of nationwide polio vaccination campaigns in February and March 2024, reaching more than 4,8 million children. Zimbabwe, like many other countries, remains at risk of polio outbreaks until the disease is completely eradicated from the world. It is, therefore, important that the population immunity against polio is maintained high. Efforts to increase routine polio vaccination coverage and strengthened disease surveillance for early detection of cases remain top priority. The world has a historic opportunity to end polio for good, but if we do not remain committed, the virus could quickly make a comeback and paralyse thousands of children again every year. Eradication may feel close within reach, but we — governments, partners, donors — must fully and urgently step up and support to cross the finish line. We did it for smallpox, and we can do it again — it is humanly possible.  Etleva Kadilli, Unicef regional director, eastern and southern Africa and Christopher J Elias, is president of global development at Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.    "

                    ","ZIMBABWE’S misfortunes are a burden to many who love this beautiful country. Our country cries out for a collective purposeful focus to lift it out of this man-made quagmire. We must look past the preoccupation with sectional party-political interests. Our future lies beyond what politicians can do for us. We must be laser focused on what we each can do to first change ourselves and then change our spheres of influence. While there is so much dysfunction in our country, most of our guests on YouTube.com//InConversationWithTrevor remind us that it is our honest endeavours that change our society. It is the things we work passionately on for the benefit of others that cause positive ripples and profit us. Each of us have power to change this country by searching for our why and pursuing it passionately. Harriet Tubman emphasised the importance of understanding our past in shaping the future, stating: “We are not informed by where we are; we are informed by where we have been.” Where Zimbabwe has been says that while politics destroyed this country, with our participation by commission or omission, it is leadership and enterprise at an individual level that will build something greater on these ruins. The emergence of our better angels will eventually shape the political landscape and not vice versa. No magic wand, no quick fix, let alone an individual will transform Zimbabwe. Nation building is heavy lifting, multifaceted, time consuming and needs all hands on deck. To aid our individual endeavours are 10 overarching factors with tremendous potential to transform Zimbabwe, namely: The direct link between rule of law and development is well-studied and has long been established. Our problems are far bigger than Zanu PF and the opposition or the real and perceived differences between President Emmerson Mnangangwa and Nelson Chamisa. A solution to our dysfunction will emerge when there is scale in the number of people who bet for the country rather than self or sectional interests. Noble causes take time to become mainstream, but when they do they create a groundswell which hatches its own leaders. "

                     Let’s build a strong AI adoption framework
                    ","RESEARCHERS argue that people's perceptions of reality shape their adoption of technology. The excitement and confusion surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) highlight the importance of underlying assumptions, meanings and expectations about the adoption of this important technology. These interpretations significantly impact AI adoption, making a clear framework crucial for any organisation or country navigating this process. Do you think Zimbabwe is adopting AI well? The answer hinges on whether you know the framework that the country is using to guide its AI journey. What is a framework? In the context of technology adoption, a framework is a structured approach that guides the introduction of a new technology. It acts as a plan, outlining the essential steps, considerations and best practices to ensure successful integration. Think about building a house. You would not just randomly put up walls and a roof. A blueprint, which acts as a framework, describes the different stages of construction, the materials needed and the order in which things should be built. Similarly, a technology adoption framework provides a roadmap for the effective use of the new technology. AI is a hot topic, and many countries are scrambling to adopt it and Zimbabwe has also made some inroads. As a country we have shifted from questioning “should we adopt AI?” to “are we adopting AI the right way?” This series delves into this crucial question and as a Member of Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on ICT, I have observed numerous efforts by both the public and private sectors to create and adopt AI solutions. The troubling aspect is that these efforts lack a guiding framework or a dedicated AI plan. As explained earlier, the absence of a framework hinders strategic AI adoption. This has hampered many African countries in the past when adopting technologies. We often rely on foreign frameworks, leading to limited benefits from these technologies. China's New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP), announced in 2017, serves as a powerful case study for the importance of a national AI plan.  This ambitious plan outlined China's goal to become the global leader in AI by 2030, create a trillion-yuan AI industry, and shape ethical norms for AI development. The AIDP provided a long-term vision, fostering domestic AI research, talent development and public-private collaboration. Looking back, it is undeniable that this strategic approach has positioned China as a leading force in AI. Global race for AI supremacy AI has emerged as a new battleground for international competition, with nations recognising its potential to drive economic prosperity and national security. Developed countries are prioritising AI development to boost competitiveness, accelerate their economic growth and national security. Many developing countries have also joined the race and are intensifying their implementation plans and strategies for this core technology. Key areas of focus for developing countries include infrastructural development, research and development, talent development and establishing regulatory frameworks. Zimbabwe's call to action Looking at the global landscape, it is clear that Zimbabwe needs to elevate AI development to a national strategic level. To compete and thrive in the future, a comprehensive framework for AI adoption is critical. Pillars of a successful AI framework As mentioned earlier, a successful AI adoption framework should possess the following characteristics: Provide structure: Break down the AI adoption process into smaller, manageable steps, making it less daunting and more achievable. Identify key considerations: Focus on crucial considerations throughout the process, such as infrastructure requirements, human resource needs and potential risks. Integrate best practices: Incorporate existing global best practices and lessons learned from previous technology implementations. Adaptable: Be flexible enough to be tailored to Zimbabwe's specific needs and context. Charting the course This series will delve into a comprehensive framework for advancing AI in Zimbabwe. We wll define key steps across various domains to ensure the effective integration and responsible deployment of AI technologies. Our goal is to equip key stakeholders with valuable insights into Zimbabwe's AI readiness and potential hurdles. This will lay the foundation for informed decision-making and strategic planning concerning AI development in Zimbabwe. "

                     ZiG is yet another infernal nuisance
                    ","GOOD day, President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Your Excellency, my conscience affirms that the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) is yet another infernal nuisance. As I see it, it is deficient, devoid of the core fundamentals of a propitious currency. Truly, ZiG is not an economic eureka. It is burdened by a credibility crisis. Like the buffalo soldier Bob Marley sang about, who fought for survival on arrival, ZiG was never destined to have it easy. Henceforth its introduction was shrouded in mistrust due to Zimbabwe being a commonly loathed black sheep regionally and far beyond. Hence, your 2018 application to rejoin the Commonwealth is still pending. Your Excellency, Zimbabwe has accumulated massive negative returns because of its propensity to hold harmonised elections that fail the credibility test. Notwithstanding the punitive sanctions that were recently imposed on you by the United States government, indeed, your government has an onerous credibility deficit. There is a cost to a government in the hands of a ruling elite of low reputation. It cannot evade censure for attaining power illegitimately and for not being respectful of human rights. The fact that ZiG is backed by gold and other precious minerals, however, does not suffice to build confidence. It failed to set forth sighs of relief that are ordinarily expected as a welcome to a currency that is billed as being backed by gold and other precious minerals. It is a verity that Zimbabwe is bequeathed with an abundance of minerals, ranging from gold, diamonds to many others. It actually takes a geologist, of which I am not one, to roll call the deposits of mineral treasures which, all things being equal, could sufficiently back the ZiG. Yet, besides the abundance, citizenry is not convinced that the said reserves of natural resources are available in requisite quantities to back ZiG. Given that there were grey areas with regards to the quantities of gold that were in the vaults at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), during your recent inspection visit, a dearth of trust was pronounced. Consequently, ZiG is yet another infernal nuisance. It is apparent that citizenry regards the notion of ZiG being backed by gold and other precious minerals with not only suspicion, but also askance and disdain. Your Excellency, citizenry remembers well the gold corruption exposé investigative documentary, Gold Mafia. It was an antithesis of accountability and transparency that government retaliated by unleashing tirades on the news channel that compiled the document. And, government went on to renege on its promise to investigate the corruption allegations that were raised in the documentary. Prior to that, the late former President Robert Mugabe alleged that US$15 billion worth of diamonds had fallen into corrupt hands in Chiyadzwa. Yet again, no investigations were carried out. With ZiG coming as it does on the backdrop of apprehensions due to previous collapsed currencies and corruption, it is inevitably struggling for acceptance. Indeed, citizenry is sceptical about ZiG, through and through. Your Excellency, Zimbabwe has an unsavoury reputation for introducing new currencies now and then. Since independence, failed currencies have been your government’s Achilles heel. All successive currencies failed to hold their own. Now, as ZiG replaces the Zimdollar that progressively lost value henceforth your reintroducing it in 2019, from where I stand, ZiG is not an economic eureka. I reckon the vendor who said she would rather lose a sale than accept ZiG stated with exactitude the magnitude of the disapproval rating of the new currency. Its a yawning deficit of confidence and credibility which is commensurate with the reputation of your government. Verily, the introduction of ZiG ought to have set alight a flaming euphoria that could have generated anticipation and acceptance of the currency if the fundamentals were correct. Yet, that has not been the case as the ZiG’s launch was as a dull as the recitation of platitudes. Your Excellency, ZiG is shrouded in a plethora of credibility and legitimacy crisis. Methinks citizenry is of the conviction that ZiG is by no means the long anticipated economic eureka. Given the magnitude of mistrust in government, duly, ZiG inevitably suffers a likewise fate. It, therefore, needed skilful communicators to execute its launch. Yet, with all due respect, it is the irony of a national launch of the new currency that the crew that is spearheading the ZiG introduction does not exhibit a thing or two about public relations. They have hardly shown themselves as congenial and credible. With all due respect, they are not given to persuasion. It is small wonder that their wooden approach can be attributed to ZiG being overtly regarded as yet another infernal nuisance. There is a gulf of credibility deficit that yearns to be bridged. Consequently, the engagement of articulate communicators ought not have been foregone. As I see it, the failure of ZiG to excite citizenry could have been minimised had the launch been planned diligently. It is my studied evaluation that the RBZ governor John Mushayavanhu ought to gather and bundle himself neatly. He has to add communication mastery to his remarkable professional faculties. Otherwise, the inevitable history of failed currencies will be perpetuated under his watch. His contradictory statements are detrimental to building of confidence and acceptance of ZiG. Considering that he sits at the pole of the apex bank, truly, probity warrants him to invest in acquiring communication proficiencies. He must be an accomplished communicator whose concise statements are ethical and renowned for clarity of thought and credibility. It is of paramount importance that he be admirably conclusive, coherent and convincing in his communication. His backtracking on the conceptualisation of ZiG after the World Bank clarification of the bounds of its consultancy role, is detrimental to his reputation as the incumbent RBZ governor. Your Excellency, be that as it may, forsooth, ZiG is yet another infernal nuisance. "

                     Benefits of integrating food systems with education
                    ","AFRICAN agriculture cannot be transformed in isolation because in most agriculture-driven economies agriculture anchors more than 75% of other sectors. The fact that agriculture and food systems transformation require some technical knowledge from technocrats along value chains is a major reason for tying food systems to the education sector. Technocrats like agronomists, agriculture economists and livestock specialists often come from tertiary institutions whose knowledge can only be valuable if curricula are frequently reviewed. Power of specialisation Broader agriculture and food system transformation is about specialisation through which value chains can be fully exploited instead of exporting raw commodities which happens due to lack of rigorous specialisation. For instance, one of the reasons most African countries continue to export fruits in a raw state is because these countries have not invested in knowledge in fruit processing and value addition through formal education systems including tertiary institutions. Countries importing raw fruits from Africa have kept specialised knowledge to themselves as part of protecting their advantages which they do not want to lose by sharing highly specialised knowledge. After farmers have done their part by producing all kinds of commodities, the onus is on African academics and researchers to become specialists in ensuring African food commodities are not exported in a raw state. That is why education curricula should produce specialists for every commodity at every level. Each African country should have more food scientists than political scientists and each commodity should have a big team of food scientists from farm to fork. Given that more than 70% of agricultural production is in the hands of women, gender and women’s empowerment in agriculture should be an integral component of university curricula at the same level as production, logistics and food processing. More value can also be generated when institutions of higher learning like polytechnics and universities are twinned with communities. It is unfortunate that institutions of higher learning are missing in the production of appropriate technology which has become a domain for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in infrastructure and equipment enterprises. Given that the majority of youth who fail to succeed academically end up in agricultural production and marketing, creates opportunities for peer-to-peer knowledge transfer in line with key characteristics like age and gender. It is easier for youths to convince each other as they are good at communicating through tools like ICTs. However, ICTs should not be used as an avenue for taxing ordinary people for the benefit of a few. For instance, African banks, mobile service providers and insurance companies are using ICTs to siphon money from people who have become addicted to social media. What is the source of information for transforming agriculture and food systems? If education curricula are silent on information sources it is difficult to achieve transformation. This is because, due to a competitive mindset, private companies share knowledge selectively. In most cases private companies promote their good side through ignoring lessons and challenges which may actually be more important. One the other hand, public sources of information like mass markets can provide valuable information because they have much exposure to many actors and impacts. Academic institutions can use the food system to generate evidence with great potential for influencing policy attention towards the recognition, support and protection of mass markets, SMEs and availing of appropriate technologies on processing and preservation. When support becomes part of national programmes driven by colleges and universities, the fiscus can see value in supporting academic departments that are developing home-grown agricultural supply chains and food systems. Knowledge around appropriate food preservation technologies can be embedded at industrial parks occupied by the young generation who are attached to colleges and universities. This is how colleges and universities can unlock more value from key economic drivers in production zones where more than 30% of horticultural produce is lost due to lack of appropriate food preservation technologies. Consolidating all these outcomes will enable policies to support the creation of industries that are embedded with knowledge and skills from colleges and universities which can assist in creating employment for graduates from institutions of higher learning. As long as higher learning institutions are not generating knowledge and skills that can grow agriculture and food systems into a viable industrial ecosystem, graduate unemployment will continue rising since there will be no industry to absorb all graduates churned out by tertiary institutions every year. SMEs are currently dominated by people whose knowledge levels may not be able to employ sophisticated graduates. It means graduates from colleges and universities have to develop frameworks for creating their own employment. Government is doing its part by providing an enabling environment for academic institutions to apply their knowledge and lure private investors who can build frameworks for employing graduates. Much can be achieved by streamlining academic programmes from the current more than 100 subjects being studied in one university department. For the sake of uniformity and consistency in consolidating and rolling out relevant knowledge, the subjects should not be more than 20 in one department because the more the subjects the shallower the knowledge outcomes. A consolidated framework will also assist in positioning supply chain actors and supporting institutions that are currently working in silos instead of collaborating through synchronised knowledge, expertise and skills towards recognising, supporting and protecting the agricultural sector and food systems. Absence of positioning and consolidation is one of the major reasons why there is a mismatch between knowledge and information about the needs of each supply chain node. When more than 90% of the knowledge acquired at higher level is underutilised in communities, it translates to low return on investment. Critical questions include: Who is driving African agriculture and food systems and what level of expertise do those people have/need? What skills base is driving the agricultural sector and entire food systems? Colleges and universities should be positioned at a level where they can answer some of these questions in building higher level expertise models that can then be unpacked for lower-level institutions. Consolidation is also required at the level of government departments so that the Agriculture ministry does not continue to run with its own extension officers without any relationship with other government departments like industry, health, ICTs, local government and commerce or SMEs. Consolidating initiatives made by several institutions of higher learning and other stakeholders can also enhance resource utilisation and re-purposing in ways that generate more value. When data, information and knowledge are consolidated, it becomes possible to approach mass markets as institutions not a collection of individual farmers, vendors and traders. Production zones will also be considered institutions that should have a strong relationship with formal institutions for purposes of knowledge co-creation, adding value to resources on the production side as well as making visible the contribution of SMEs and mass markets to socio-economic development. Currently, there is no such consolidated platform in most African countries, making it difficult to see synergies between existing supply chain technologies such as ICTs, production technologies like irrigation systems, preservation technologies, food processing technologies and many others. Gaps can only be seen and closed through consolidation which can also assist in answering questions like: Due to the prevailing mentality which does not recognise rural communities, production zones, mass markets and SMEs as institutions with valuable knowledge and skills that can guide industrial development, most African universities are not approaching mass markets and similar institutions for student attachments. Yet, at a time African countries are grappling with global knowledge and home-grown indigenous growth pathways for transitioning from colonial systems, it is not enough to depend on formal academic education and formal companies. No wonder structural unemployment is increasing in most African countries as shown by how most academic qualifications do not match industry requirements. To what extent can the so-called informal sector continue to be called informal when it is the one providing wage employment as shown in African mass food markets. "

                     Gummies vs. flower vs. concentrates: The difference between THCA products
                    ","The cannabis industry has seen a remarkable evolution in recent years, with a wide array of products entering the market, catering to a diverse set of preferences and needs. Among these, THCA products stand out for their unique properties.  THCA is a non-psychoactive precursor to THC, the compound primarily responsible for the euphoric effects associated with cannabis. THCA products come in various forms, including flowers, vapes, concentrates, and gummies, each offering different experiences. Let’s explore the distinct characteristics of these products, providing insights into their effects, benefits, and suitability for different types of users. THCA is found in the trichomes of fresh and undried cannabis plants. Its transformation into THC, the psychoactive counterpart, occurs through a process called decarboxylation, which is induced by heat. Research has highlighted the potential of raw THCA in various therapeutic areas. It exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, and its neuroprotective effects are being studied for potential roles in treating neurodegenerative diseases.  Furthermore, THCA has shown promise in reducing nausea, making it a compound of interest for medical cannabis research. Despite its benefits, the non-psychoactive nature of THCA means that it does not interact with the body's endocannabinoid system in the same way as THC.  This distinction is crucial for users seeking the therapeutic benefits of cannabis without the psychoactivity.  However, for those interested in the traditional effects of cannabis, the conversion of THCA to THC through decarboxylation is a key process, allowing users to experience the mood-altering effects of THC. When THCA is heated, be it via lighter, vape coil, or something else, it turns into THC, and once that happens, your THCA vape, flower, or concentrate will give you the same exact benefits as THC (because that’s what it turns into)! These include: The THCA flower consists of the dried buds that contain THCA alongside other cannabinoids and terpenes.  The process of smoking or vaporizing the flower applies heat, triggering decarboxylation and converting THCA into THC. This traditional method of consumption allows for the immediate onset of effects, as the cannabinoids are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream. The experience of using THCA flower is influenced by several factors, including the strain, the environment, and the individual's biological makeup.  Some strains are bred for higher THCA content, leading to stronger effects upon decarboxylation. Smokers of THCA flower appreciate the natural aspect of the product and the ability to control the dosage through the amount consumed and the rate of inhalation. THCA concentrates represent a more refined and potent form of cannabis. These products are created through extraction processes that isolate cannabinoids, including THCA, from the plant material.  The result is a product with a much higher concentration of THCA, which, when decarboxylated, produces a powerful THC effect. Concentrates like live resin and rosin are particularly popular for their high purity and potency. These products are often consumed using methods like dabbing, which involves vaporizing the concentrate on a hot surface and inhaling the vapors.  The high concentration of THCA in these products means that even a small amount can produce strong effects, making concentrates a favorite among experienced cannabis users. The appeal of THCA concentrates lies not only in their potency but also in their ability to preserve the terpene profile of the cannabis plant, enhancing the flavor and aroma of the product.  However, the powerful effects of concentrates may be overwhelming for beginners or those with lower tolerances, making it important for users to start with small doses and gradually increase as needed. THCA vapes are a modern and convenient method of consuming cannabis, appealing to users who seek the benefits of THCA without the harshness of smoke.  Vaping devices heat the cannabis product to a temperature that activates the THCA, transforming most of it into THC, depending on the specific temperature used.  This method allows for precise control over the decarboxylation process, enabling users to tailor their experience based on their preference for THCA or THC effects. The technology behind THCA vapes focuses on delivering a clean, controlled dose of cannabinoids through inhalation, with less risk of combustion and the harmful byproducts associated with smoking.  These devices range from disposable pens to more sophisticated, rechargeable systems that can adjust temperature settings for optimal vaporization of THCA. THCA vape products often come in a variety of strains and flavors, incorporating terpenes and other cannabinoids to enhance the user experience.  This diversity allows consumers to choose products that meet their specific needs, whether they are looking for therapeutic effects, flavor profiles, or a combination of both. THCA gummies offer a discreet and convenient way to consume cannabis without the need for inhalation or the risks associated with smoking.  Unlike flowers and concentrates, the manufacturing process for gummies typically does not involve high levels of heat, meaning the THCA remains in its original form and does not convert to THC.  This makes THCA gummies an attractive option for those seeking the therapeutic benefits of cannabis without the psychoactive effects. The gummies are designed for oral consumption, with the cannabinoids being absorbed through the digestive system.  This method of consumption results in a slower onset of effects compared to inhalation, with the full impact often taking up to an hour or more to manifest. The dosage in gummies is carefully controlled, allowing users to easily manage their intake and avoid the risk of overconsumption. Choosing between THCA flowers, concentrates, and gummies depends on several factors, including the desired effects, the user's experience level, and personal preferences regarding consumption methods.  For those seeking immediate psychoactive effects, THCA flower and vapes offer the advantage of rapid decarboxylation through heat. People wanting immediate and intense effects should opt for concentrates. On the other hand, THCA gummies provide a non-psychoactive option for those interested in the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis without the high. The choice between THCA flower, vapes, concentrates, and gummies is highly personal and depends on the desired effects, individual preferences, and consumption method comfort levels.  Those seeking immediate and potent effects might lean towards concentrates, while users looking for a traditional and communal experience may prefer flower. For those interested in health benefits without intoxication, gummies offer an appealing alternative. When choosing a THCA product, it's essential to consider factors such as potency, onset time, duration of effects, and personal health considerations.  Smoking or vaping provides rapid effects but involves inhalation, which may not be suitable for everyone.  Concentrates offer high potency, which requires cautious dosing, especially for beginners.  Edibles offer a smoke-free alternative with longer-lasting effects, though the onset is slower, and dosing can be less precise. Product Type Consumption Method Decarboxylation Psychoactive Effects THCA Flower Smoking Yes Yes THCA Concentrates Dabbing Yes Yes THCA Vapes Vaporizing Yes Yes THCA Gummies Oral No No As the cannabis industry continues to evolve, so too does the range of THCA products available to consumers. From artisanal concentrates to gourmet edibles, the market is rich with options catering to every preference and need.  By understanding the distinct characteristics and effects of THCA flowers, concentrates, and gummies, consumers can make informed choices about their cannabis consumption, tailoring their experience to their desired outcomes. The choice between THCA gummies, flower, and concentrates ultimately comes down to personal preference and the specific effects each individual is seeking.  Whether looking for a potent psychoactive experience, a gentle introduction to cannabis, or the therapeutic benefits without the high, there is a THCA product suited to every need!

                     Effective communication: An invaluable problem solving tool
                    ","THE late American radio speaker and author Earl Nightingale once said that “successful people are not people without problems”. They are simply people who have learned to solve their problems, he said. Good communication skills are the bridge between confusion and clarity. They are the road to personal and career success. In this article, we will discuss what it means to be a good communicator and how one can grow their communication skills. Good communication is nothing more than effective communication of our thoughts and ideas. The degree of our success is determined by the extent to which we can communicate our needs. Effective communication is not just about being able to talk, but also about being able to express your thoughts and ideas with clarity and charisma. It is a skill that can be honed through regular practice and improvement. When communication is clear and concise, it leads to better understanding and reduces the likelihood of conflicts. Here are some habits to cultivate in order to become an effective communicator. Be articulate  The majority of people fall victim to using filler words like “umm,” “like”, “you know”, which can be seen as a lack of confidence in what one is saying. Consider the ease with which your bones glide in their sockets, exhibiting a fluid articulation. Likewise, it is advantageous for our communication to emulate this. When one speaks articulately, their concepts are conveyed more effectively. Pause before you respond Oftentimes when faced with a question the immediate reflex is to respond. When we are quick to respond we may not give our mind enough time to formulate a thoughtful response. Rushing to answer could result in using filler words or stumbling over our words. Therefore, it is wise to take a brief pause to gather your thoughts before communicating your response. Ask questions “The ability to ask questions is the greatest resource to learning the truth,” said Carl Gustav Jung, the late Swiss psychiatrist. We cheat ourselves of learning opportunities whenever we shy away from asking questions. Both intelligent and seemingly stupid questions are worth asking. Curiosity is the ladder to knowledge, and thus it is better to know the answer to a seemingly simple question. Write Writing is one of the best and oftentimes underappreciated tool that can sharpen our communication skills. Spend time writing out your thoughts and ideas. When we write we refine our ideas. Actively listen Instead of listening to respond, we should listen to understand. When we understand what is being communicated, it is easier to avoid conflict caused by misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Identify your objectives and be concise When our objectives are clear, it is more likely that we will get a satisfactory response.

                     Zimbabwe can’t develop on the back of slave labour
                    ","IT is heartening that President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa actually believes that workers are the cornerstone to Zimbabwe attaining its developmental goals. He indicated this to commemorate this year’s Workers Day. The head of State proceeded to “applaud the vital role that labour plays in the realisation of our national development goals”. Wow! However, Mr President, all this is very hard to fathom, taking into consideration the unbelievable poverty and suffering workers in Zimbabwe face each day. How can their dedication and resilience be “applauded and commended” when they are treated as slaves in their own country? Surely, is throwing over two-thirds of the workforce into unimaginable poverty — as they earn below the poverty datum line — a way of showing appreciation for the hardworking men and women? This is also a country in which an estimated 49% of the population lives in extreme poverty — earning, according to the 2023 United Nations classification, less than US$2,57 a day, which is the international poverty line. In other words, anyone taking home less than US$77 a month should consider themselves extremely poor. I actually believe that those falling in this category in Zimbabwe are far more than the 49% official figure, since this was for 2020 when economic factors such as inflation were at lower levels than today. Right now, the government’s own employees, the civil servants are some of the lowest paid workers not only in the country, but also in the southern African region. Despite endless promises of improved remuneration, as well as other so-called “non-monetary benefits”, such as solar systems for their homes, 50 000 housing units and others, virtually nothing has been fulfilled. After deductions, the majority of civil servants in Zimbabwe do not take home more than US$200 per month. According to the latest Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency figures, an average Zimbabwean required over ZWL$700 000 (which is around US$50) in the month of March 2024 for food alone. This means that, just to purchase food, a family of six needed at least US$300. How many workers in Zimbabwe, whether in the public or private sector, are not earning anywhere near this amount just to cover basic food only? But as we all know, “man cannot live on bread alone”. One needs to pay for accommodation, utilities, school fees for children (and other education-related costs), transport and clothing, among many other expenses. How are the vast majority of Zimbabwean workers expected to survive? Based on several reports I have come acorss, the situation is even worse for those employed by Chinese companies operating in Zimbabwe. These employees are some of the most abused and exploited in the country. Not only are they reportedly compelled to work under the most hazardous conditions (without sufficient protective gear), but are also poorly paid and, in most cases, not even paid their salaries for months. In fact, reports are awash of workers being physically assaulted by their Chinese bosses. The most harrowing message I received was from an employee who alleged that a woman at one lithium mine died after the company refused to provide transport when she had been referred to Harare for critical medical attention. This resulted in flash protests in the workers’ compound against the mining company, which were ruthlessly crushed allegedly with the aid of local law enforcement agents. All this is taking place while these Chinese mining companies are unapologetically pillaging our mineral resources worth billions of dollars with scant regard for human rights and environmental considerations. The fact that these employers are permitted or even protected by the Government of Zimbabwe paints a disturbing picture of the general plight of workers across the country who are viewed as nothing more than slave labour. Both the government and the private sector have adopted an “if you don’t like it, the door is open” attitude. So, when Mnangagwa talks about valuing workers as the “cornerstone to Zimbabwe’s aspirations towards attaining its developmental goals’, what exactly does he mean? Is he talking in terms of developing the country on the same lines as the transatlantic slave trade — when countries like the US recorded phenomenal economic growth on the back of slave labour? Are those Mnangagwa’s aspirations? Is this how Zimbabwe is expected to achieve Mnangagwa’s envisioned Vision 2030?

                     World Press freedom in the face of green propaganda onslaught
                    ","FOR centuries, nations relied on the power of the media to foreground their agendas, to establish their communicative functions, ideological inclinations and hegemonic characteristics. Robust and powerful global media institutions like BBC, CNN, Agence France Press and Reuters, among others were born. While the term “Press freedom” maybe relative, it serves to remind the world of the role of the media as the fourth estate. As this happens, environmental journalists in many countries have been captured, while journalism as profession is at cross-roads, safety of journalists is at stake, and language has been used as a distabilising tool. This article aims to unpack why developed countries, especially Western rich nations, which are also the major sources of carbon emissions, seek to control other nations by using scientific and quasi-scientific terms and language for hegemonic purposes. While developed countries stand accused of the above machinations, developing countries with toxic and repressive media laws have invested in the grim fear factor, cowing journalists into a narrow, tunnel-minded and subjective lot. Many developing countries witness a plunder of natural resources in the extractive sector, human rights abuses and casualties, while journalists have been hammered into disinformation tools, bellowing for their supper, trading their souls for pieces of silver and soup. While Press freedom is vital, there is no freedom in Press freedom, it is just a mirage and myth. This is because the media has the power to expose the looting in the extractive sector, it is either they keep mouths zipped or they report falsehoods, praising systems that impoverish citizens or they pay the price of reporting as it is. For these reasons journalists around the world are compromised, pay allegiance to powerful looting cartels, use twisted words and logic, a culture of lies, deceit and lack of depth, while contributing to disinformation and misinformation, communication massaging and mischief, leading to crass linguistic miscarriage. Every situation is stage managed, doctored and choreographed, with grandstanding overtaking logic and burying the truth in the process. With language of capitalism in the form of green propaganda, sometimes referred to as lexical creativity or green discourses on the rise, information has been compromised, with no knowledge on knowledge economy, contributing to linguistic consequences and death of objectivity. Rich-polluting multinational conglomerates with money to broadcast, have disseminated concerns related to climate issues and they currently manipulate people in the developing world by persuading them to think in particular ways using language that conceals their ideological and hegemonic purposes. In this view, it is the rich and powerful countries that have largely participated in polluting the earth at the same time using language to manipulate weaker and poor nations. The massive linguistic invasion in the public sphere may have major ideological effects — that is, they can help to produce and reproduce unequal power relations between social classes, women and men, and ethnic/cultural majorities and minorities through the ways in which they represent things and positions of people. Adoption of such communicative clusters like “green”, “eco” and “carbon” is designed to depict nature, colour and images of the environment as peaceful and serene. The online green dictionary has taken language and communication by storm and utilised the role of compounding to churn out creative lexico-grammatical terms like “carbon footprints”, ‘green discourses”, “eco-culture”, “carbon emergency” and “green buying and living”, among a host of others. While rich polluting nations and companies use language and other means to manipulate people’s minds and shape their thinking, developing countries maximise on corruption, depletion of natural resources and perpetuate environmental crimes, by promoting gutter journalism to praise sing and misinform the public. State apparatus is used to protect corrupt government officials by harassing and jailing journalists for exposing environmental crimes. Both rich carbon emitting nations and repressive governments in developing countries are promoting environmental crises using money, language and repressive laws to make life difficult for professional journalists. While anti-conservationists hide behind linguistic clusters like “green” or “eco”, looters of State resources in developing countries target journalists who cross their path by exposing corrupt officials. While it is the duty of the environmental journalists to unmask environmental crimes in the extractive sector, using the same language that is used by powerful nations to camouflage their emission behaviours, it takes the use of the same linguistic tools and apparatus to correct these wrongs of generated linguistic crimes. Rich polluting nations advertise heavily, market aggressively and have strong media institutions, powerful communicators and linguists to support their cause and keep the world diverted from their emission crimes. Their language use is over-repeated until it sounds true. In developing countries, environmental journalists have no protection, therefore, they report environmental crimes at their own peril. The linguistic propaganda from developed countries is so powerful because it is backed by statistics, practical examples, financial resources and highly sponsored conferences, among others. This language is designed to have impact on its users and they continue generating new green vocabularies leading to linguistic aberration. Green propaganda has permeated every facet of language use, with terms like “resilience”, “sustainable”, “adaptation”and “climate action and justice” being more prominent, tired and overused. Environmental journalists and the journalism profession are at a crossroad, with the profession more dangerous than ever before. Environmental journalists need protection globally as falsehoods and disinformation stink to high heavens of which some governments are hiding behind this to justify sovereignty and heritage while plundering natural resources as if there is no tomorrow. Natural resources are finite and environmental journalists are critical not only in exposing environmental crimes, but also in contributing to environmental literacy, education, awareness, knowledge and information.

                     Is latest global steady economic growth real?
                    ","DESPITE having endured many major challenges and setbacks over the past half a decade ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the Eastern wars (Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza) and the raging climate crisis, the global economic outlook shows a possible steady growth, at least according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD comprises of 38 member countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It is a forum whose member countries describe themselves as committed to democracy and the market economy, providing a platform to compare policy experiences and seek answers to common problems. It also seeks to identify good practices and co-ordinate domestic and international policies of its members. Most OECD members are described as high-income economies ranked as very high on the Human Development Index and are regarded as developed countries. In short, most of its member countries are involved in the ongoing major wars in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Eastern Africa. And the economic projection may be part of the propaganda ahead of several major elections. Or maybe, it is just how they choose to see the situation despite that the wars are taking a huge toll on economies. Nonetheless, considering that most major global economies will hold elections this year — if the projections are anything to go by — this shows that economies have become increasingly resilient to major shocks. It may also mean that they have found ways of navigating some emerging challenges that threatened economic recovery after the COVID-19-induced pandemic. It may also mean that global economies have found opportunities in some of the major wars with the economic benefits far outweighing the negative impacts. Some literature shows that the impact of external wars on economic growth tends to be primarily temporary as markets quickly shift to absorb the war industry into their arms and become part of their major sectors. The war industry, despite its harmfulness to life, traumatising effect, economic disruption, immorality and humanitarian impact, is seen by some dirty investors as an opportunity for quick money and more profitable because of the unchecked government expenditure. The excessively high-profit margins are seen as among the reasons wars become protracted. Nonetheless, the global economy is continuing to grow at a modest pace, according to the OECD’s latest economic outlook. The economic outlook also projects steady global gross domestic product growth of 3,1% in 2024, the same as the 3,1% in 2023, followed by a slight pick-up to 3,2% in 2025. The organisation further notes that the impact of tight monetary conditions continues to be felt in Western markets, particularly in housing and credit markets, but global activity is proving relatively resilient, the decline in inflation continues and private sector confidence is improving. Real incomes are expected to rise in many OECD countries as inflation moderates and trade growth has turned positive. The outlook continues to differ across countries, with weaker outcomes in many advanced economies, especially in Europe and strong growth in the United States and many emerging market economies. Whether this outlook reflects reality or not, the organisation notes that significant uncertainties remain due to the economic instability in China, global wars and a lack of disposable income among households. Inflation may remain higher for longer thus resulting in slower-than-expected reductions in policy interest rates and leading to further financial vulnerabilities. Slow economic growth in China due to the persistent weakness in property markets or smaller-than-anticipated fiscal support over the next two years could disrupt global growth. Current major wars and geopolitical tensions also remain a persistent significant risk to economic activity and inflation, particularly the ongoing conflicts in the Middle Eastern and Eastern Europe and their logistical impact on the Black and Red Seas. Whether it is by design or default, there is no mention of addressing or stopping the major wars among the recommendations provided by the OECD as a means to sustain the projected economic growth. It instead highlights the need for durable reduction in inflation, establish a budgetary path to address rising fiscal pressures, and undertake reforms that improve prospects for medium-term growth. “The foundations for future output and productivity growth need to be strengthened by ambitious structural policy reforms to improve human capital and take advantage of technological advances,” says OECD chief economist Clare Lombardelli. The International Monetary Fund provides a sobering and more objective economic outlook which shows that future growth prospects are souring. Global growth will slow to just above 3% by 2029, according to their latest World Economic Outlook report. This is threatening to reverse improvements to living standards, and the unevenness of the slowdown between richer and poorer nations could limit the prospects for global income convergence. It recommends strengthening and promoting the key drivers of economic growth which includes labour, capital and productivity as a way out of the potential economic crisis.

                     The language of success
                    ","AT times, we need to break out from our norm into a life of adventure, risk, happiness, newness and true potential. There are times when we walk in life bored and without looking forward to anything exciting at all. At times, we reach a plateau and we move in auto pilot; doing the same things over and over again. A good example is when we go to a job every day. We know what we should do and we do it without even thinking at times. It is no longer exciting but a cold routine, we have the skill and it looks like we do not need any creative thought to it. Such is life! The question becomes: How do we break that norm and create our new normal? Drop the word “fine” When we greet people, their most obvious response is “I am fine!” Stop and think. What does that really mean? Most people settle in that zone called fine. It is generally good. There are a number of terms that depict this level and these are “OK”, “fine”, “ordinary”, “acceptable”, “normal” and “average”. Here your mind tells you that things have always been like this! Things do not change or will not change and let us accept them as they are. You are the one to make things change. American entrepreneur, author, and motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, you do not become successful by chance but by change — change to an extraordinary, exuberant, epic, adventurous life. Get into fun, freedom and fulfilment! Get to new things. Take a risk, scuba dive, do not settle for less, break your own record, invent more, break old patterns or paradigms, create new rituals, make more profit, add one hour to your reading schedule, work harder and more wisely and create new friends. Consciously enlarge your business networks, travel to new places and spice up your love life. Do not settle for the “OK”, but go for more in life. The new money language There are times when you feel there is a lid or cap on your money. You cannot go beyond a certain limit. You have been earning so much over some time and it seems you have reached your perimeter. If I would ask: How much are out earning now? For how long have you been in that same stream? Blow-off the lid to your current cash flow into your life. You can have more. Increase your belief.  Increase wealth or prosperity consciousness. Financial stagnation needs increased faith, fights and replacing your old monitory mental files. Create new targets and work more. Set new financial dreams. Double or triple your financial targets. See yourself earning double what you currently earn and your mind will figure out how you are to make that. See yourself rich and walking in financial freedom and independence. Replace disempowering thoughts with positive thinking. Shed negative friends, habits, spend less, spend wisely, learn more to earn more, increase your net worth by growing your networks. Have more streams of income. Create more opportunities for self-development. Replace all liabilities with assets.  Liabilities are things that take away money from you and assets bring value to you. Dream again Probably people that are above 65 years would think they are old enough not to dream again and the young think there is still more time on their side. So, these two categories leave everything to chance.  Nothing comes by chance, but most fortunes come by change. See yourself with new dreams, more money and better health. Go back to school. Get back into the game of life. Do not marvel on your past successes, create new ones.  Get into the groove. Dance again at 89. Renew your marriage vows at 75. Find new love. Do it! Dreaming anew makes you look forward to better things ahead. In his motivational talks, American politician and motivational speaker Les Brown usually says when the end comes, let it find you climbing new mountains and not sliding down the old ones. Do not let death find you on your death bed, but let it find you in your field working on your passion fervently. Speak positively to yourself Most people suffer from what has been called inferiority complex. They think they are not good enough, they are ugly and they are too short. If I may ask you, did you create yourself? It is definitely no! Now, why waste your time on things you can not change? See the beauty in you! See the masterpiece from the Maker! Do not wait to be told by someone that you are beautiful. Some think they are too fat to be loved. Whereas others think they are to blame for not being married. Do not wait for love. Love yourself. Give yourself more love. Others think they are too thin to be in love. Whereas some think they are too short to feature on the outer cover of a magazine. Stop wasting time and start living your life! Tell you what? Self-blame adds nothing good to your life. This is your life, live it to the best. Do not waste time thinking what others are thinking about you. I too suffered all that same until I woke up, dusted myself and I said, “Jonah, it is time to rock! Let’s do this!” If I had believed all those stories, I would not be writing for this column. I would not have published my books. Worse still, when I stood in front of people my head  would spin and mind just froze, but I had to tell myself that, “Jonah if you continue in this kind of mediocre mentality you will amount to nothing. Let us get to work”. Having been in rural areas, worse still in a poor background, my mind would have told me, there are better people to do what you are doing. I fought all those negative thoughts. No need to seek approval Most people do not feel confident until they seek approval from others. Never sell yourself short, you are very special, even if people are not saying so. Never underestimate yourself and never grossly over-estimate other people’s intelligence, you are intelligent in your own right. Never live a wrong script of what others say about you and do not ever live other people’s lives and lies. Kick fear away. Do the very thing that you fear doing and you will learn that there is no lion beyond the veil. It is just an image you have created in your mind. Break all your records. It’s time to live your passion, purpose and do it positively. Jonah Nyoni is an author, speaker, and leadership trainer. He can be contacted on X @jonahnyoni. WhatsApp: +263 772 581 918 "

                     Press Freedom and climate journalism: United in crisis
                    ","JOURNALISM is in crisis, again. The challenges to Press freedom are enormous and multi-faceted and they are deepening — in “free” and open societies as well as autocracies. And there are no simple solutions. For individuals and entire media outlets, the crisis is existential. Nearly 100 journalists and media workers have been killed since the Israel-Gaza war began last October — the worst death toll in a conflict zone in decades, the Committee to Protect Journalists says. Others have been arrested, wounded or gone missing. Family members have also been killed. Some journalists understandably believe they are targeted by Israeli forces. Beyond the threat to life and limb, tens of thousands of media jobs were lost in 2023 and the trend this year is no better. Entire outlets have shut down, or been taken over and/or dumbed down. In our world of enhanced digital chaos and the font of bigotry and disinformation which is social media, audiences are as increasingly fractured as the news outlets they choose to turn to. Bots and AI-generated deep fakes will compound all this politicised confusion and mistrust. Torrents of trivia, subtle scare-mongering and old-fashioned intimidation are a potent combination in the erosion of freedoms and democracy. Russia has seen a mass exodus of journalists. Hong Kong is a shadow of its former self. Myanmar’s regime is a killer and jailer of reporters. But in an increasingly polarised United States, by some counts, over two-thirds of Americans say they don’t trust their mass media. There is excellent reporting happening but much will pass unseen, or dismissed outright. South Africa’s membership-based Daily Maverick shut down for an entire day in April to draw attention to how market failure was endangering independent journalism. “Without journalism, our democracy and economy will break down,” the outlet declared. How all these very different factors are coming together is clearly seen in the media coverage of our global climate breakdown and broader threats to our environment. The environment is not just a highly dangerous topic to cover — sometimes akin to conflict reporting — but it has become a cesspit of corporate propaganda emitted by polluting industries, some of them giant State-owned entities, as well as their partners in disinformation ensconced in politics, academia, “non-profit” foundations and the mass media themselves. Unesco is dedicating World Press Freedom Day this year to the importance of journalism and freedom of expression in the context of the current global environmental crisis. As Unesco says: “Independent journalists as well as scientists are crucial actors in helping our societies to separate facts from lies and manipulation in order to take informed decisions, including about environmental policies. “Investigative journalists are also shedding light on environmental crimes, exposing corruption and powerful interests, and sometimes paying the ultimate price for doing their job.” As India, the world’s largest democracy, holds elections 10 years after Narendra Modi first took over as prime minister, Reporters Without Borders noted that at least 13 of the 28 journalists killed in India since then were working on stories linked to the environment, mainly land seizures and illegal mining. Several were killed while investigating the so-called sand mafia, an organised crime network supplying the construction industry. Reporters Without Borders ranked India 161st out of 180 countries in its 2023 World Press Freedom Index. In the Global South, indigenous, local, and independent journalists and communicators are particularly vulnerable to violence and intimidation while working in remote areas without adequate backup and resources. But in the world’s industrialised democracies — those that blazed the trail of bio-diversity mass extinction, pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases overheating our planet — major media outlets are actively aiding and abetting fossil fuel companies by partnering them. As laid clear in a report by the outlets Drilled and DeSmog, many major media outlets have “an internal brand studio that crafts editorials, videos, even events and entire podcasts for advertisers, many of which are fossil fuel companies”. “The likes of Politico, Reuters, Bloomberg, the NYT, the Washington Post and the Financial Times are all creating content for oil companies that directly contradicts what their climate reporters are publishing. And we know from peer-reviewed research that at most one-third of people can actually tell the difference between advertorial content and reporting.” Journalists, particularly those covering the climate crisis and collapse of eco-systems, also have to confront those almost intangible contradictions that thwart efforts to engage and inform the public. How does one communicate the magnitude of the dangers facing us and our planet to a global audience already bowed down under a barrage of awfulness? How does one resist what one US political scientist referred to as the “banality of crazy”? He was referring to Donald Trump’s violent, sexist and racist rhetoric which has been heard so often that it sometimes barely stirs a media reaction, but the phrase could be used to describe other kinds of dangerously acceptable new-normal. There is no one easy answer to all this. Freedom of the Press rests on just that. It also depends on our own integrity and credibility. - Farhana Haque Rahman "

                     Is Zim opposition still left-leaning?
                    ","THE May Day celebrations in Zimbabwe confirmed one thing: the beginning of the end of the relationship between the opposition and the unionised workers in the country. It was a bad day for the opposition and a curse for the future. It was curious that the main opposition party did not give a solidarity statement at the May Day celebrations at Gwanzura Stadium in Highfield, Harare. This is despite the fact, the opposition MDC which has since morphed into a number of factions was originally midwifed by the trade unions. It was the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) that in 1999 convened the National Working Peoples Convention (NWPC) which among its resolutions was for ZCTU to consider forming a political party that carried the aspirations of workers. To all intents and purposes, MDC was a left-leaning political party. A party that had workers, students and peasants’ interests at its core. Over the years, the party split over personality and ideological clashes among the top leaders. However, until 2018 it still had a semblance of being a leftist party. Human rights activist and independent blogger Takura Zhangazha encapsulated well the changes in the opposition in his blog. He wrote: “As we proceeded with not only the formation of a working peoples political party and constitutional reform via referendum campaigns in 2000, we also became aware of what was a third hand in our activism. This was of the white liberals who had access not only to money but also international foreign policy support. “We could not easily fend these comrades off. They had embedded themselves within our popular support and eventually decided to influence the Morgan Tsvangirai leadership team from any leftist leanings.” I would add, it was not only the white liberals but also a motley of black nouveau riche who could not help, but became even more liberal than the whites. Secondly, the rise of personality cults within the opposition is not based on any ideological inclination but populism. These developments have led leftist Zimbabweans on the crossroads. A decision has to be made whether to be swallowed by the tide of liberalism or join the bandwagon of ideologically bankrupt populism? Yes, there is also the third option, leftist reorganising and getting back to the basics. I can’t help but borrow once more from Zhangazha’s blog on this. He wrote: “But what is important is that the labour movement survived the fact of its support for a new political party. The ZCTU still exists. And for that we are grateful.” Zhangazha is also aware of how it is not easy and a number of things have to change among the workers if they have to rest. “The only challenge that appears to be emerging is that labour rights activism is increasingly being diminished mainly because workers are no longer as conscious as they used to be of their rights.  But also, because scarce employment opportunities have made unionism abstract or unimportant.  “Most employees in the contemporary world no longer care about workers’ rights.  They simply want to keep their jobs and never question or organise on behalf of collective worker interests,” Zhangazha opined. As Zhangazha correctly observed, many workers do not think that they are simply labourers in the true sense of the word because of the positions they hold. They are oblivious to the fact that most are only one paycheck away from poverty. If that point becomes clearer to those in lofty position and opinion leaders then we would understand the reasons for leftist political parties are still unfulfilled a quarter of the century later after the formation of the MDC. Workers, students and peasants are worse off than they were 25 years ago. Many earn far below the poverty datum line, education has been privatised, the public health system is in comatose and the majority of pensioners now need to depend on social welfare. Now is the time for the left to awaken from their slumber or the lull by liberals of trickle-down economics. It needs no further exploration that the time is ripe for the working class to unite and rescue themselves from the clutches of neoliberal economics. Is it not shocking to Zimbabwean workers that employees in the United States, the United Kingdom, German or the Nordic countries have minimum wages, basic health insurance and even free tertiary education? Why should Zimbabweans be going where others are coming from? It is time that workers of Zimbabwe unite and realise they are their own saviours. That politicians and political parties should be voted because their policies are aligned to the aspirations of the people, not because they are handsome or popular. It came out very clearly from the ZCTU that workers are struggling and cannot make ends meet. Working conditions are getting worse and there is no pension to talk of. Now the ball should be in its court and they organise a second NWPC for a way forward. After all is said and done, all the big political parties in Zimbabwe are just different shades of neoliberals, they all worship capital and see privatisation as a panacea to all the economic ills the country has. We need new politics. We need new politicians. It is a sad conclusion that the leftists have changed, they have gone to bed with capital. The workers themselves have to come back to rescue the situation. It is a truism that it is either you are at the table or on the table. Capitalists don’t think twice before they have workers for dinner. Workers now, more than ever, have to be organised and be at the table themselves or very soon the tribe known as trade unionists will be extinct. There it is — workers of the world unite and we only have the chains to break. "

                    ","TEACHING prayer in ministry or denominational setting is a bit easier because we then pray. On a platform like this, I appeal to you to stand with us and pray especially now that we are breaking down the walls of legalism, tradition and religion. Let me enlighten you a bit more. Since satan has seen that the church is praying, he will not necessarily stop you from praying but leave you praying with dissatisfaction because no answer will be coming from God. As long as the church is bitter with God and the cloud of darkness is left uncovered by the truth or rightly divided Word of Truth, the church will be always complaining and some will leave the faith. Complaining or murmuring is fertile ground for not realising the promises of God. We are careful not to be so much engrossed in the mechanical aspects of prayer, thereby defeating the fellowship the Father intended to have with His children. Many panic and try all sorts of antics like covering up for God that the situation was resolved. By night, witch doctors will be busy helping “Christians”. An act will be put up by testimonies in the church for a “breakthrough” that came from the devil. At some point a whole assembly will be nicodemously visiting the same witch doctor or false prophet/ess. What was previously a Christian assembly becomes a cult. Where God is, you do not need to cover up for Him. Sometimes the mechanics we mentioned earlier are pulled out. This is where we end up having satanic things like dangerous prayers, back to sender or the sorcerer must die. God wants the sorcerer, witch doctor, wizard or any perceived enemy to be saved. 1 Timothy 2:4, reads, “Who [God] will [desires to] have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.” After being saved, the believer has to know the truth. Prophecy had already foretold in the following rhetoric question, Ezekiel 18:23, “Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?” Other mechanics used are like, let us use time windows when sorcerers are busy like midnight or at 1 am. When you fail to wake up to pray that slot, the whole day you will be seeing satan and defeat. Faith will be driven by fear. Some resort to try entice God with a vow and call it the prayer of Hannah or the blessing of Jabez. The devil likes it so much when a believer has a mindset that the Father is so hard to get answers from. He really smiles when we conclude that we are not doing enough before we pray because he knows we will not receive. He smiles when you conclude that you are cursed and always looking for being blessed. All these have no place in the New Testament. The Gospel of Christ is the blessing. We read Acts 3:26, “Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.” Space will not permit to quote from the epistles and letters how we are already blessed. A believer is blessed because salvation is the blessing. Everything that comes from God is by grace and, therefore, a gift without human effort. Apostle Paul tells us in Ephesians 2:8-9, “[8] For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.” We endeavour to teach in love and avoid examples that point towards any denomination or ministry or person. We do not look for powerful believers or prayer warriors. Is that so? We pray to a powerful Almighty God and Father. Do not discredit yourself. Should you have prayer partners? Yes. God is looking to develop your own prayer life. It will be unfolding more and more as we continue with this series. Jesus explained the spirit of the Scriptures in Luke 9:54-56, “[54] And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did? [55] But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. [56] For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.” The Bible is clear that we are not fighting human beings. We are in the day of salvation. What we have already quoted shows that God does not want your enemy to die. 2 Corinthians 6:2, teaches, “(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)” We have crossed from death to life and cannot pray according to the deadness of sin. Our Way is new and alive according to Hebrews 10:19-20, “[19] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, [20] By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;” We will explain this more next week so that we do not try fables like through and by the blood of Jesus. If you are born again, the blood of Jesus puts you in the living way. The Bible is clear that we pray in the name of Jesus. We don’t strengthen prayer by praying in the name and by the blood of Jesus. Selah! Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen. Grace and peace be multiplied to you through knowledge.

                     When the mind needs a helping hand: Exploring  the world of neuropsychology
                    ","HAVE you ever felt like your memory isn’t as sharp as it used to be, or found yourself struggling to focus or switch between tasks? Maybe you have noticed it’s harder to follow conversations or plan things out like before. If these challenges sound familiar, it might be time to consider seeing a neuropsychologist. Neuropsychologists are the detectives of the psychology world. They specialise in understanding how the brain and behaviour are connected. Imagine your brain is like a complicated highway system. Neuropsychologists figure out where the traffic jams are, why they are happening, and how they are affecting your daily life. They work closely with people who have faced a variety of challenges, from those born with conditions like autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder to those who have suffered injuries or illnesses that affect the brain such as strokes, brain tumours or dementia. When you visit a neuropsychologist, they will guide you through a series of tests. These are not tests you can pass or fail but are designed to measure how well different parts of your brain are working. You might solve some puzzles, answer questions, or use blocks or computers for tasks that seem simple but reveal a lot about how your brain processes information. These tests help pinpoint the specific areas where you are having trouble, which is crucial in planning the best treatment or strategies to help you manage or overcome these challenges. The field of neuropsychology in Zimbabwe is growing, bringing new opportunities for specialised care. In 2021, Zimbabwe registered its first neuropsychologist, Kudzai Nyakusendwa, and the University of Zimbabwe began offering a degree in this field. These developments mean that more people can now access care that understands and integrates their cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. It is a big step forward because it opens up previously scarce and locally unavailable services, helping to ensure that neuropsychological care is more relevant and accessible to everyone. Even if you are not ready to see a neuropsychologist, there are simple things you can do everyday to keep your mind sharp. Taking short breaks throughout your day can greatly benefit your mental health and cognitive abilities. Practising deep breathing for a few minutes, stretching or taking a brief walk can refresh your mind and improve both focus and creativity. Short breaks help to mentally reset and can make you more productive when you return to your tasks. Setting aside time to let your thoughts drift freely can be surprisingly beneficial. This practice, often referred to as “mind-wandering”, can enhance creativity and problem-solving. Allowing your mind to wander can lead to moments of insight and innovation, similar to anecdotes about great thinkers like Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs, who embraced periods of solitude and reflection. Everyday, people make numerous small decisions that, although seemingly minor, can deplete mental energy, leaving less for more critical decisions. To combat this, try simplifying your daily choices. For instance, choosing your meals for the week or selecting your outfits in advance are practical steps you can take to minimise decision fatigue, thus preserving your mental energy for more significant decisions. The brain tends to be most alert and rested after a good night’s sleep. Therefore, it is beneficial to schedule the most demanding tasks for the first part of the day. Tackling challenging tasks in the morning ensures you address them when your cognitive abilities are at their peak. Understanding the role of neuropsychologists and leveraging their expertise can significantly improve your quality of life if you are dealing with brain-related challenges. It is essential to ensure that any neuropsychologist you consult is registered with the Allied Health Council of Zimbabwe to guarantee that you receive competent and professional care. "

                     Winter wheat preps: What farmers should prioritise
                    ","THIS year's summer season witnessed diverse and contentious rainfall patterns, which are largely attributed to El Niño-induced droughts that have disproportionately affected smallholder farmers. In early April, government acknowledged the necessity for assistance, as it designated the prevailing drought a state of disaster and estimated that approximately US$2 billion will be required to provide humanitarian aid. As the current wild season is almost on its periphery, ahead of us is yet another exciting winter season for winter cropping to which participating farmers are currently gearing up. Winter cropping consists of cultivating crops tolerant to sub-zero or near-freezing temperatures for their growth and development cycle and requires considerably lower temperatures to initiate their reproductive phase, a phenomenon known as vernalization in grains. In Zimbabwe, winter crops that are predominantly cultivated include wheat, barley and oats as grains and diverse horticultural crops. Among these, wheat is the most significant cultivated winter crop in Zimbabwe. In fact, wheat is the second most prominent “grain crop” after maize, while it is the third most prominent crop in general, after maize and tobacco in Zimbabwe. Its significance alludes to the ever-increasing demand for flour-made foods, such as bread, biscuits and breakfast cereals. Zimbabwe requires approximately 350 000 tonnes of wheat annually to sustain itself, which is difficult to achieve. Nonetheless, the 2022/23 season became a historical breakthrough when this target was surpassed, with much credit going to the government for its pragmatic investment in this crop and the agricultural sector. Unfortunately, unlike other global regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as the Western Coast of South Africa, which receives winter rainfall, Zimbabwe’s winter season is exclusively characterised by limited to no rainfall. Thus, winter wheat farming in Zimbabwe is entirely based on irrigation, which, in turn, systematically excludes numerous farmers who rely on dryland farming. In other words, the major ticket for winter wheat farming in Zimbabwe is the availability of irrigation facilities, which tend to favour commercial farmers while leaving out smallholder farmers. In this regard, winter farming may not necessarily underperform to the extent of summer performance. In general, in wheat farming and winter farming, sufficient preparation is essential because of the instant switch from summer to winter. Unlike summer crops, which have several planting dates throughout the season, wheat is highly selective on planting dates and requires early planting. In Zimbabwe, recommended early planting dates for wheat range from mid-April to mid-May, which reduces the two major risks of missing cold temperatures at the vernalisation stage and the coincidence of summer rains during harvesting. Additionally, in some cases, the wheat planting window may coincide with the harvesting of summer crops, which might be laborious for farmers. Thus, it is imperative for farmers to take note of proper preparations and here we highlight some tips. They should also ensure that all previous loans and debts are cleared. Self-financing can be complicated because of the large investment demand, particularly on a commercial scale. Proper preparation prevents poor performance. With proper preparation, wheat farmers have a great chance of achieving their wheat yield potential during the rough dry season. This will be crucial to meet the country’s wheat output targets and a repeat of the 2022/23 season’s breakthrough, which will halt the continuous dependence on imported wheat because Zimbabwe has the capacity to produce its own.

                     Zim’s moving coffins: The untold story of targets
                    ","A ZEBRA Kiss bus driver, Mike Makwara (49), was slapped with a two-year jail term for causing a fatal accident along the Harare-Nyamapanda Highway at the height of a route war. Makwara was banned for life from driving heavy and public service vehicles. On January 12, 2023, along the Harare-Nyamapanda Highway, Makwara was driving a bus belonging to Zebra Kiss heading towards Mutoko. Another bus from Rimbi Travel and Tours was also heading in the same direction. The Rimbi bus driver wanted to overtake but was blocked by Makwara who kept driving in the middle of the road and at times encroaching onto the opposite lane. As a result of continuous obstruction, the Rimbi bus rammed into a tipper truck, killing the conductor on the spot. All this was captured on a phone camera by a concerned passenger. The video went viral igniting anger among citizens who condemned the bus driver’s terrible behaviour. According to the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ), about 90% of road accidents are a result of human error. “I admit that human error is the major cause of road accidents in the country but of late, the rate at which buses are involved in road accidents is alarming, there is more to it,” a director at Arrive Alive Awareness, Isaac Simbarasi said. In April last year, a Timboon bus disaster claimed 13 lives in an accident that occurred between Chivhu and Murambinda due to speeding. Since then, the frequency of road accidents on local roads has been unbearable. A number of drivers, however, revealed that the issue of “targets” should be stopped since they cause bus drivers to operate under a lot of pressure. “We work on targets and most of the times we are under pressure to achieve that or we lose our jobs,” said a bus driver who plies the Harare-Mutare route. “My target per day is US$500 and I have to meet that. The employer gives me 10%of that. If I surpass the target, the remainder is mine. If I work for 10 days meeting that target it means I have US$500 commission, also the surplus is mine.” According to the World Health Organisation, around 1,3 million people are killed each year on global roads, while a further 20 to 50 million are injured each year around the world. In Zimbabwe, according to TSCZ, an average of five people die everyday on the country’s roads, with an estimated 2 000 people dying each year on the country’s roads. Speaking during a visit to the Timboon bus accident scene, Transport minister Felix Mhona emphasised the need to have all buses installed with speed limit devices. The call has, however, fallen on deaf ears as Zimbabwe’s roads have been turned into racecourses all in the name of meeting targets. Pirate taxi drivers who ply the 74km Marondera-Harare route said they were forced to do five trips per day to meet their targets. They drive the popular Toyota Pro-Box vehicles ferrying 11 people instead of five. “Our target is US$50 per day and we are forced to do an average of four trips (to and from) per day. Four people are in the boot and each trip gives me at least US$26. From that I deduct US$3 for the touts, US$4 for the (Goromonzi) tollgate, US$3 to bribe the police at a roadblock, already I am left with US$16 without talking of fuel. “I have to sacrifice one of two trips for the fuel, we have to speed to meet the target. The vehicle owner will be waiting for his full amount of money,” said a Pro-box mushikashika driver. Instead of being given commission, pirate taxi driver are given a day to operate within a week for their remuneration. “Most vehicle owners pay us by giving us the vehicle a day per week. So I have to maximise and get more money to add to the surplus I get during these six days. Some opt to give us 20%  of the total amount earned that month,” said the pirate taxi driver. Mhona said government was mulling the introduction of a bus timetable system in a bid to deal with the rising deaths on the highways. Passenger Association of Zimbabwe’s Tafadzwa Goliath said: ""The bus timetable system is recommended as it stops bus drivers from competing for passengers. Yesteryear, for example, a traveller in Rusape would know that his or her bus would be at the rank at around 11am from Harare. It was systematic. The issue of money targets need to be investigated by authorities."" Government has failed to walk the talk on reining in speeding public transport drivers. The highways have turned bloody due to accidents caused by speeding triggered by targets. “For now, we continue to lose lives on the country’s roads if authorities do not step up and avert the problem being triggered by targets. It is now a common feature for a bus driver to hit the 140km per hour mark as they race at the mercy of innocent passengers,” Simbarasi added. "

                     ZiG will stand or fall on public trust, nothing else
                    ","THE manner in which the government introduced the new currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), is proof that little or nothing has been learnt from previous similar experiences. Zimbabweans are still traumatised by the destruction of wealth that was caused by five other attempts to rein in galloping inflation including the introduction of bearer cheques and bond notes. At the time of writing the black market was setting the pace, which is partly a reflection of the public’s mistrust of government. A course correction, in communication and confidence building measures, is required to avoid further currency weakening. To assuage the traumatised public all tools of moral suasion should have been deployed to get buy-in from all stakeholders before and after the launch. Pointing out that ZiG is backed by gold does not explain why bond notes that were supposedly backed by a US$200 million Afreximbank bond facility failed dismally. The recent threats made by government officials, betray lack of faith in gold’s ability to back the new currency. Force, a trusted weapon, is being summoned to back ZiG. The arrest of black-market currency dealers is proof that there is a chink in this strategy. It does not help that there is suspicion that currency traders represent the politically connected.  The one element that has sustained money since ancient times is trust. From the days when human beings used cowrie shells, then grain and livestock in exchange for goods and services, trust has been the bedrock upon which money stands.  Money, as Yuval Noah Harari (Sapiens) and Jacob Goldstein (Money) argue in their books, is a fiction whose value is sustained by our common imagination. “In other words, money isn’t a material reality — it is a psychological construct,” argues Harari in his seminal book. Harari continues: “Money is not coins and bank notes. Money is anything that people are willing to use in order to represent systematically the value of other things for the purpose of exchanging goods and services.” Only 8% of the world’s money exists in notes and coins. The bulk of it exists only in computer servers. It is trust that binds this fiction together. For this social construct and fiction to hold all stakeholders must willingly go along. The fiction is sustained by general consent and never by decree. In our environment where confidence in government is non-existent trust is actually a currency. Since the launch of ZiG both the RBZ and government have done little to promote this currency. For instance, ZiG notes and coins came into circulation on Tuesday April 30, and yet no visible promotion had been rolled out. Persuading people accustomed to using the greenback to adopt a local currency after dollarisation is a Herculean task. International Monetary Fund data indicates that there have only been two countries that have successfully de-dollarised, namely Israel and Poland. Zimbabwe is following the script of all countries that failed to de-dollarise, namely, “administrative enforcements without fully restoring confidence in the local currency or eliminating the underlying instability that led to dollarisation in the first place.” The trust chasm between the government and the public is humongous largely because of government’s dismal track record. There are other questions that have layered this mistrust, namely the elephant in the room pointed out by ex-RBZ governor Gideon Gono. The RBZ has no autonomy and it is hard to dismiss the suspicion that the President has unfettered access to national coffers. Chris Mutsvangwa’s allegation that gold was stolen from RBZ vaults during the late former President Robert Mugabe’s era was inopportune. Having the President’s son as deputy Finance minister erodes public trust. The RBZ Act says the “governor is appointed by the President after consultation with the minister.” The optics are just not right. Also, the statutory instruments recently enacted to shield parastatals from public scrutiny undermine public trust in our financial governance.   To show full confidence in ZiG all government departments, including local government should conduct transactions in the local currency. Taxes should also be paid 100% in ZiG. It is impossible to overstate the importance of a stable local currency to undergird a vibrant economy, sovereignty and national pride. It is crucial that ZiG earns public trust and be widely used. For this to happen, government and the central bank must solicit public trust through their words and actions. "
https://www.newsday.co.zw/opinion-analysis/article/200026337/the-power-of-naming,"
                     The power of naming
                    ","NAMES are not just a random collection of letters. Rather they are sign posts that point to who we are and where we come from. From the moment we are born, our names begin to shape our identities. They somewhat predestine us positively or negatively. But what if your name carried more significance than just being a label or you? What if it held the key to your future? Understanding the meaning and significance of a name is like unlocking a treasure trove of understanding the bigger picture beyond naming a thing. Whether we realise it or not; our names hold a great deal of power. They can influence the way we are perceived by others, our sense of self-worth and even our life paths. Since time immemorial, naming has always had been treated with paramount importance. “What is your name?” is a question that you are likely to answer time and again in this life. Aside from making social interactions awkward as well as fostering a way to remember information, names reveal striking information about human psyche, cultural changes, familial lineages as well as geographical variations, among others. This makes our understanding of the power of naming a necessary evil for all us. And you ask, is this necessary? Well, your answer is here and now. I trust your questions will be dealt with and you will appreciate why you need to embrace the power of naming. Allow me to draw to your attention to the fact that naming can have a huge impact on how you perceive and interact with the world around you. The people, food, places and other things that you know is a result of naming. You can make your differentiations and distinctions of things through naming. Naming is, therefore, a rich and complex process. When we start naming the environment and the things within it or the universe correctly, the way we perceive ourselves and our sphere of influence, immediately changes. Just think of the power of saying, “I am a child of God”; “I am a winner”; “I am a leader” or “God is my father.” Hey! Such a mindset will not just help you with a name, it is an identity and a relationship with yourself, your environment and your maker. What then is naming? Let me start off by defining what naming is. Understanding the meaning of naming and significance of our names is like looking up at the sky — it connects us to something more beautiful than ourselves. And just like looking at the sunset, it changes our perspective. Acknowledging and embracing the truth of a name changes our perspective. Undeniably, understanding the meaning and significance of naming also helps us to see our place in the world and our relationship with God. Pedantically, naming is assigning a name to something. Culturally, naming can be seen as a ritual or ceremony in which a person’s name is given or announced.  God formed beasts of the field and birds of the air out of the ground and brought them to Adam so that Adam would name them. The names Adam gave are the names for the beasts of the field and birds of the air to this day. Genesis 2 vs 19b reads, “He brought them to the man to see what he would name them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.” And to us, the names we give or we were given, have a certain aura they create for us. When you grasp the significance of your name, it is like you have discovered a piece of your identity that was hidden from plain sight. Some names have negative or unfortunate meanings, which can be quite a burden to carry around. Imagine having to live with a name like that! But even in those cases, there is an opportunity for redemption. In Isaiah 62:2 there is a line which reads, “And you will be called by a new name.” People can take ownership of their names and redefine what they mean. They can turn their bad news name into a symbol of their resilience and strength or power. It is all about how you choose to approach your name, is it not? There are so many things that are supposed to be yours but the problem is they have no names. Suppose you are a parent and you give birth and name your child as is the norm, that child has been sealed as your own and all things being equal no one can come and claim that child from you unless you are an abusive parent. Suppose you want a wife, a car, a house or any other thing, you need to name the things into existence. If you cannot name it and if you cannot picture it, then you cannot have it. I want you to understand that the nomenclature process encompasses a wide range of disciplines such as etymology, onomastics, toponyms (names of places) and anthroponyms (names of people). Your name did not come by accident and what you do not have is also not by accident. You need to rise up to the occasion and name something. Naming creates critical pillars of our individual as well as collective identity and stirs emotions, fosters connections and promotes inclusivity. The critical canons of this life, opine that, “experience is the best teacher.” We need to be extra cautious when it comes to naming. The names you give are more like rubber stamping a behaviour or character and before you know it, the telltale signs will emerge and will be difficult to thwart. Suffice it to say, names are an incredible part of identity. Name encapsulates identity. What names are attracting your social capital? Well, this is food for thought. Stay intrigued! "

                     ZiG brought more misery for consumers: CCZ
                    ","THE Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) says the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency has brought more “challenges” for consumers than those they faced prior to its introduction, because people are failing to use the new currency outside the formal retail sector. ZiG was introduced last month to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, but the new currency has faced public resistance, especially from commuter transport operators, making life difficult for consumers. “As the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe, we were delighted when we heard that we are going to have a currency backed by gold reserves being announced by the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe,” CCZ chief executive officer Rosemary Mpofu told NewsDay Business in an interview. “We were very excited because we heard the country had enough gold to back the new Zimbabwe Gold currency. We very much believed that when the currency is backed by gold and other commodities, it would give more value to our currency.” She said they believed that the money would give people more buying power like such other currencies as the South African Rand, Botswana Pula and the United States dollars. “With that being said, as consumers, we are facing several challenges, which has resulted in us failing to easily accept the new currency,” Mpofu said. “These challenges have greatly impacted the acceptance of the new local currency by consumers in the country. It seems the new currency has brought us more challenges than those we faced before the introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold currency.” Mpofu noted that commuter operators were not eager to accept the new currency and were charging the public double the normal price because they cannot provide change. “When boarding public transport on our everyday normal routes, we see that the same route that we used to travel using US$0,50, we are being charged US$1 because of change challenges,” she said. “Sometimes we are forced to buy things that we do not want just for us not to leave our money with public transport operators. The same route that I used to travel using US$1, to and from, the price has doubled.” She also complained about how consumers were failing to buy fuel using the new currency despite the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) announcing fuel prices in ZiG. “Moreover, when it comes to fuel in the country, it was announced recently that consumers are now able to buy fuel in local currency and Zera announced the ZiG prices for fuel. However, we have not seen any fuel station that is accepting ZiG in exchange for fuel. We did a survey and also consulted with Zera and we discovered that so far, no fuel station is accepting ZiG,” she noted. Mpofu also expressed her worry that service providers were rejecting the new currency, while others were still manipulating the exchange rate. “Another challenge is emanating from schools. Several schools are rejecting the payment of fees using the new currency only accepting the US dollar. Where else are we going to use the ZiG currency? “So far, the only place we can use the ZiG currency is in the supermarkets. Why are the service providers rejecting the ZiG currency?” she quizzed. “Another pressing issue is that of the exchange rate. We were told by the central bank that the rate will be at US$1: ZiG13,56 with an allowance of service providers to have a margin of up to ZiG14 according to statutory instrument 118. “However, we are seeing some charging with rates as high as US$1: ZiG21. We need to know what RBZ [Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe] and the FIU [Financial Intelligence Unit] are doing to deal with this.” She urged the authorities to address these pressing issues and restore confidence in the new currency. “So as CCZ, these are some of the challenges that consumers are facing, and on behalf of the consumers, can the authorities look into these issues to bring confidence in this currency?” she queried. “They need to make sure that all businesses comply with the set exchange rate because they are the ones destabilising the new currency. Moreover, the authorities should continue dealing with the black market and should continue to arrest all the culprits. “Without addressing these issues, we are going to miss the target of reaching an upper middle-income economy by 2030,” she added.   "

Zimbabwe Association of Dairy Farmers (ZADF) chief executive officer, Paidamoyo Chadoka said local dairy products were uncompetitive due high production costs, which has resulted in cheap dairy products from neighbouring countries, particularly South Africa, flooding the market. “Zimbabwe lacks competitiveness due to the unsustainably high cost of production compared to regional counterparts,” she said. “Our cost of production is mainly driven by stock feeds costs, labour and cost of power, critical components which are too high when compared to other countries. “The producer price of milk per litre in Zimbabwe averages US$0,60 compared with an average price of US$0,40 per litre in South Africa, US$0,36 in Zambia, US$0,50 in Botswana and a world average of US$0,46 per litre. “The high-cost environment pushes our producer prices to be among the highest in the region. At this price most farmers are struggling to break even. The high costs of feed also compromise our milk yields significantly when compared to other regional players.” She said ZADF has launched a nationwide artificial insemination initiative aimed at improving the nation's dairy cow population and milk production. The programme seeks to elevate milk output to meet the country's increasing demand. The programme is in collaboration with key development partners such as We Effect under an International Monetary Fund project. ZADF says Zimbabwe recorded a 9% surge in milk production to 99,82 million litres in 2023 from 91,39 million litres the previous year. However, the country's annual milk requirement hovers around 120 million litres, and imports are currently bridging the gap. Chadoka highlighted the association's efforts to make semen available at subsidised rates. She emphasised that artificial insemination was an efficient method to boost dairy cattle herds, noting that ZADF was targeting all farmers, including beef producers interested in dairy genetics. “ZADF is working with all dairy farmers and some beef farmers who are willing to take up dairy genetics across the country,"" she said. “ZADF is targeting farmers in the traditional milk producing regions as well as greenfield regions taking up milk production for the first time.” While the prevailing El Niño-induced drought has also severely affected the country’s dairy sector, recent data from the Dairy Services Department, has, however, revealed a 21% increase in  milk production during the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year.   "

                     Vumbachikwe Mine faces corporate rescue.
                    ","SOME Vumbachikwe Mine creditors are advocating that the company be placed under corporate rescue, claiming the firm was heading towards insolvency, NewsDay Business can reveal.  Vumbachikwe Mine, situated in Gwanda and owned by Duration Gold, reportedly owes various creditors, including workers, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and Zesa Holdings more than US$10 million. Priscillar Gustavo of Masamvu and DaSilva-Law Chambers, who is representing Fawcett Security Operations, said they have initiated the process of placing Vumbachikwe Mine under corporate rescue. “The application (is) in terms of the Insolvent Act 2018 which replaced the judiciary management and introduced the corporate rescue was served to the company on April 25, that a corporate rescuer be appointed to save the company,” she said. NewsDay Business is in possession of the court application filled at the High Court on April 25. In its founding affidavit, Fawcett said it has provided private security services on contract to Vumbachikwe over the past approximately 10 years. “Since about 2022 the 1st respondent has had challenges paying for the security services rendered by applicant at its Vubachikwe Mine as and when such payments fell due,” the affidavit reads in part. “By a letter dated April 20, 2023 the 1st respondent acknowledgement its indebtedness to the applicant in the sum of US$170 000 being the amount due and owing as at that date in respect of private security services rendered by the applicant for the period from 2022 to 2023 at Vubachikwe Mine.” Vumbachikwe has not been operating since November 2022 after workers downed tools over outstanding salaries and poor working conditions, among other issues. Sources told NewsDay Business that the case would be heard in court tomorrow (Friday). Reached for comment Vumbachikwe Mine spokesperson Robert Mukondiwa said: “I cannot comment on something that I have not seen because that would be speculation. I need to see it and consult our legal team because what you are talking about is a legal document.” Duration also runs Gaika Mine, Athens Mine and Royal Family. "

                    ","INDUSTRY and Commerce minster Mangaliso Ndlovu says he will be establishing very “close communication” channels with industry over the next two weeks to find areas of co-operation. This is a follow-up to a meeting which Ndlovu had with retailers on Monday this week to discuss the impact of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency on their business. According to Ndlovu, manufacturers were increasingly demanding payments in United States dollar. “Government will always support such investments,” the minister said after touring two new National Food Holdings Limited plants yesterday. He toured a US$5,6 million pasta manufacturing plant and a US$7,7 million biscuit making line. “It gives confidence for them to continue investing. And like I say, I’m very excited when it’s a strategic investment that either leads to import substitution or growth of our exports,” he said. “These are areas that we will be supporting quietly strongly. We will be establishing in the next week or two, I think, very close communication channels across industry just to make sure that from a policy perspective we work together with the private sector.” Ndlovu said the ministry would be crafting most of these policies in that framework. “We will make sure that we take on board the valuable views coming from industry,” Ndlovu said. Amid inflationary challenges being faced in the market, made worse by the current drought, industry needs policy consistency to continue operating. However, Ndlovu said government supports investments such as those by National Foods which lead to import substitution and lower demand for foreign currency. National Foods Holdings’ investment into the two new plants is part of a wider US$40 million investment over the past three years to upscale its production levels across the entire business. National Foods Holdings chief executive officer Mike Lashbrook said while drought remained a threat, the firm was confident that it had enough grain to produce up to June 2025. "

                     London firm targets bulk-mining in Zim
                    ","LONDON Stock Exchange-listed metal exploration company Kavango Resources is consolidating bulk-mining to increase Zimbabwe’s gold production, NewsDay Business can report. The company, which has begun work at its Hillside gold project in Matabeleland South province, disclosed that the nation’s bulk-mining potential remained largely underdeveloped as the process requires the open pit mining of a large ore body in order to be economic. “Kavango has consolidated strategically-sized land packages around a number of historic high-grade gold mines in the Matabeleland region of Zimbabwe,” the mining firm said in a statement following release of assay results for its Hillside project. “The company’s objective is to investigate their wider, under-developed bulk-mining potential. Bulk-mining is the large-scale extraction of near-surface gold from vast open-pit mines. Because of the large quantities of ore being processed, bulk mining allows gold to be produced economically from lower-grade material than high-grade underground mining.” Open pit mining has become the dominant style of mining in Western Australia and has been the primary driver behind Australia’s emergence as the world’s leading gold producer in recent decades. The firm believes Zimbabwe’s geology mirrors that of Western Australia as the country has a rich history of high-grade gold mining across its greenstone belts. However, it added that Zimbabwe’s potential to host a multitude of large-scale, bulk minable gold deposits remained largely undeveloped presenting the nation with an immense economic opportunity. Kavango said many of Zimbabwe’s historic high-grade mines and the areas surrounding them were split into small ground claims held by various owners. As the firm is consolidating claims into packages on the scale required for economic bulk mining to take place, it indicated that it was using modern exploration and drilling techniques to assess potential for hosting open pit mines, helping to modernise Zimbabwe’s gold mining industry. “Kavango began an exploration and drilling programme across its three existing projects late last year, starting with its Hillside project. Work began at Hillside, and results so far have exceeded the company’s expectations, providing strong evidence of the project’s open pit mining potential,” it noted. “Last month, Kavango revealed that assays from drilling at Hillside Prospects 2 and 4 had returned wide areas of significant gold at shallow depths.” Kavango’s next steps at Hillside are expected to see the testing of the gold-bearing potential of the shears it has interpreted at Prospects two and three with a series of drill holes. This is expected to enable it to test the potential for a bulk mineable gold deposit across the entire shear zone at both prospects. The company is also awaiting assay results from Hillside Prospects 1 and 4. Drilling is also underway at its Nara project to test a 200-metre wide by five kilometres long strike corridor within the property, which have been interpreted as a potential shear zone. Drilling is also planned at the Leopard project. "

                     WestProp plots mega capital raise
                    ","VICTORIA Falls Stock Exchange-listed WestProp Holdings Limited is in talks with “several parties” as it moves to ensure the success of another capital raise expected in the next three months to accelerate its projects. The discussions come a year after an initial public offering (IPO) raised about a tenth of the amount required after shareholders subscribed to preference shares worth US$3,3 million out of the US$30 million that was on the table. WestProp chief executive officer Ken Sharpe told NewsDay Business that the company was “getting ready” for another capital raise. He said the lesson learnt from last year was that WestProp was supposed to do a book building exercise to whet the market’s appetite about the IPO. The book building exercise, Sharpe said, was a pre-marketing of the capital raise “to make sure that the market has an appetite and the capacity to fund the amount that you need”. “We are in discussions with several parties. We expect an announcement to be made within the next two to three months of a significant transaction on capital raise that will change the trajectory of the company dramatically. We are busy doing those book building exercises now,” he said. Last week, WestProp began the development of the US$300 million mixed-use Hills Luxury Golf Estate as its urban renewal push intensifies. Its other projects include Millennium Heights which is ongoing, Pokugara Residential Estate, Pomona City (ongoing), The Mall of Zimbabwe and Millennium Heights Office Park. WestProp executives were recently on a roadshow in the United States to raise more interest in their projects. For Sharpe, it was a significant moment announcing a development happening in Zimbabwe like the Hills Estate in Washington, the world’s “capital”. “I felt proud that we as Zimbabweans can get things that can be recognised by the international community. “In the capital city of one of the world’s powerhouses and announcing that Zimbabwe was going to be doing something exceptional, something that is a game changer, something that raises the bar, for me was humbling,” he said. “This gave me the confidence that this is not the first roadshow nor the last, but the first of many that we will be doing in the diaspora. Our brothers and sisters out there have access to several billions of United States dollars. That is enough money to rebuild our country.” Sharpe said while international financiers can come on board it would be more exciting when “Zimbabwean brothers and sisters” take money from their pockets and send it home. “As WestProp we are ready to build the country together and we know that with their commitment it would be much faster. We have several people committed to the project from that event and we will continue doing the roadshows.” he said. He, however, bemoaned the absence of mortgage facilities by banks which he said was not normal for any economy. “We are not a bank, but our mortgage book of US$24 million growing to US$30 million is bigger than any bank in Zimbabwe; that is not normal, that is not possible. Why are banks not providing mortgages? “Why are they not accessing international markets for mortgage-backed securities which could be sent to Zimbabwe? Sanctions have gone, but they are not active enough. My message to them is please be more active,” he said. Sharpe said the central bank could lend the statutory reserve to commercial banks at concessionary rates for lending to the real estate and manufacturing sectors, among others, as “we know we are productive”. Recently the central bank increased the statutory reserves to 20% from 15%. “We are not going to put that money into consumption. We are going to put that into permanent infrastructure that develops our country and create value. And, when we do that, the economy grows,” he said. "

                    ","ZIMBABWE Stock Exchange-listed General Beltings (GB) expects to consolidate its market position in the energy and cement manufacturing sectors in response to the impact of geo-political conflicts and El Niño-induced drought. In a statement accompanying financial results for the financial year 2023, GB chairperson Godfrey Nhemachena said Cernol Chemicals was also expected to consolidate its traditional market recovery as new models of hospitality offerings evolve. “The company expects to consolidate its market position in the energy and cement manufacturing sectors in addition to the other non-platinum group minerals as envisaged in the National Development Strategy 1 which is underpinned by the growth in the mining sector,” he said. “Cernol Chemicals is expected to consolidate its efforts in traditional market recovery as new models of hospitality offerings evolve. Existing and new strategic partners being pursued are expected to strengthen market positioning in new market niches.” Nhemachena said the geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East will continue to impact on demand patterns of mineral commodities in the short to medium term as there were no signs of cessation to the conflicts. Due to geopolitical tensions, mineral reserves will flood the markets and depress demand for minerals that Zimbabwe would ordinarily supply. This, according to him, will force local mines to curtail production or mothball operations. “These developments would in turn negatively affect the company’s downstream demand. Despite the depressed demand in the economy, the group saw total volumes at 921 tonnes, 2,5% shy of the prior year’s 944 tonnes due to improved throughput at GB division. “Cernol Chemicals market recovery efforts yielded a lower than expected outcome with volumes marginally lower than the prior year,” Nhemachena said. “Although price competition intensified in the year, total turnover at ZWL$29 billion increased by 99% when compared with prior year’s ZWL$15 billion due to sustained volumes from prior year at General Beltings and a favourable market mix at Cernol Chemicals. “Owing to the USD imported inflation and a deteriorating exchange rate in an increasingly dollarised environment, the gross profit at ZWL$11 billion was 38% higher than the prior year's ZWL$8 billion.” The company benefited from improved internal process efficiencies, which arose from scheduled plant maintenance and refurbishment. Operating costs rose by 150% to ZWL$15 billion in the prior year due to the effects of inflation and dollarised quasi institution costs. Operating profit declined by 150% to sit at ZWL$2 billion on the back of increased dollarisation and inflationary pressure. "

                     Econet says it wants to make all remittances into Zimbabwe free
                    ","Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, the country’s largest telecommunications and technology company, says its decision to make remittances from United Kingdom and South Africa free has been well received and should remain in force “for the foreseeable future”.  Econet’s group chief executive, Douglas Mboweni, said the initiative would remain in place for some time, adding that the company was in fact exploring ways of expanding the free remittance initiative to other routes, such as the United States, Europe and Middle East. “The initiative will continue for the foreseeable future. We are now actually working on expanding the free remittances to Zimbabwe to other source markets, such as the US, Europe and Middle East, so that Zimbabweans with friends and family in those regions can also benefit from our offer,” Mboweni said. “However, our group currently does not have licenses that allow us to extend the service to all markets at this time. But we are busy looking at how we can do that,“ he said. Last week Econet achieved an Africa first by opening free remittance corridors that completely eliminate the cost for remittances from the UK and South Africa into Zimbabwe. This followed the company partnering with its sister company, Sasai Money Transfer, to enable individuals and companies in the United Kingdom and South Africa to send money into Zimbabwe free of charge, with the receiver cashing out of their EcoCash US dollar wallet for free. Dr Mboweni said the market reaction to the initiative had been very positive, adding that he expected many people to start channelling remittances via Ecocash. He said there were virtually no minimum limits to how little one can send at any given time. “If someone from the UK wants to send $5 to someone in Zimbabwe, it’s ok with us. We can handle small or large amounts and it’s done in an instant.” “We believe EcoCash’s extensive network, already in use for domestic USD transfers around the country, and in particular in the rural areas, will be key in providing convenience to people in remote villages and districts to access their funds,” Mboweni said. Last week Mboweni explained that the decision to offer free remittances had been motivated by the desire to help Zimbabweans weather the challenges caused by drought.  The country recently declared a national disaster over a drought caused by the climate event known as El Niño, which has left more than 2.7 million people in need of food aid.  Some analysts and experts have urged the government to take advantage of the intermediation role of Ecocash to allow ZiG cash-in and cash-out, thereby building confidence in the new currency.

The group’s key businesses include reinsurance and reassurance, short term insurance, life and pensions, real estate and wealth management. In a statement accompanying financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, Zimre chairperson Desmond Matete said the group was in a strong financial position with real growth in total assets and excellent cash generation. “Across all key lines of our business, including reinsurance and reassurance, short term insurance, life and pensions, real estate and wealth management, we witnessed exceptional profitability in real terms throughout the year 2023,” he said. The group’s total assets uplifted by 81% to ZWL$1,180 trillion in inflation adjusted terms. The group’s healthy balance sheet position is evidence of its resilience and commitment to provide its stakeholders with security, growth and profitability. The insurance contract revenue experienced a remarkable increase of 140%, reaching ZWL$255 billion. “This strong growth is attributable to the group’s local reinsurance and pensions business operations, which collectively contributed 78% to the total premiums written during the year,” Matete noted. “The premium income growth was primarily driven by the expansion into new markets, the introduction of innovative product offerings and increased new product acceptance by the market.” In addition, the regional reinsurance business operations contributed to the overall insurance contract revenue, with premiums accounting for 17% of the total premium inflows, stemming from new business acquisitions and increased external business support. This was underpinned by improved underwriting capacity following successful balance sheet enhancement strategies. The group demonstrated a strong ability to generate new sales in tough operating environments, with the value of new business increasing to 29% during the year. Insurance service income increased by 321% compared to prior year to ZWL$77,5 billion as a result real growth in topline for all insurance entities and a slower growth of 62% in direct insurance service expenses. The group’s total income for the year was ZWL$357,6 billion, up 96% compared to the prior year. The growth was underpinned by strong real growth in insurance contract revenue in the local and regional reinsurance and life and pensions business segments; positive net investment income returns as well as fair value gains on foreign currency denominated assets. The real estate business also contributed to total income growth exhibiting significant growth in rental income, with a 138% increase in inflation adjusted terms. The group’s local operations recorded increased volumes of foreign currency-denominated income during the year at 84% as business operations shifted significantly from local to foreign currency to preserve value for its stakeholders. “Whilst 2023 was a turbulent year and presented formidable headwinds, the ZHL group is optimistic that like the eagle, it shall soar in 2024,” he said. The group’s strategy remains anchored on delivering a strong cash wallet by driving a cost-effective insurance float through momentum and scale; increasing the contribution from the regional investments; and tilting the property portfolio towards high-yielding commercial and retail sectors through near liquid investment structures. “The group will continue to consolidate on its experience and dynamism to enhance market share acquisition through innovations and new tools that embrace customer centric ecosystems which will create new value and change for its stakeholders,” he said. “This will be buttressed by significant investment in technology platforms that enhance customer interface with our business and an enduring experience engendering long term customer loyalty.” "

                    ","FINANCE minister Mthuli Ncube says government will tax US$0,02 for every US$1 leaving the country to ensure forex availability locally, as the State desperately tries to protect the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency introduced a few weeks ago. For years, the formal financial institutions’ foreign currency supply has been dwindling despite central bank estimating that there was potentially US$2,5 billion unbanked in the economy. In Statutory Instrument (SI) 80 of 2024 published in the Extraordinary Government Gazette dated May 3, 2024, government will retain US$0,02 for every US$1 leaving the country. These changes were made under the Finance Act whereby the Finance Amendment of Sections 22B and 22G Regulations, 2024, introduces changes to the automated financial transactions tax and the intermediated money transfer tax (IMTT). “Section 36G (2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate US$0,02 on every dollar of every outbound foreign payment or part thereof for each transaction on which the tax is payable,” Ncube said in the SI. The move is most likely to affect local industry importing raw materials and foreign headquartered businesses operating locally, who are remitting back to their respective countries. Also, the new measure will affect outbound remittances and those who transact online with businesses not domiciled in Zimbabwe. Such a move will likely add to the already high cost structure of businesses and further pile inflationary pressure on the economy. Ncube also introduced new charges for withdrawing ZiG and on local currency transactions. “It is hereby notified that the Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion minister has, in terms of Section 3 of the Finance Act [Chapter 23:041, made the following regulations: These regulations may be cited as the Finance (Amendment of Sections 22B and 22G) Regulations, 2024 Amendment of Section 22B,” he said. “Section 22B (‘Automated Financial Transactions Tax’) is amended by the repeal of Section 22B(a) and substitution with the following: For each withdrawal above the local currency equivalent of US$100, a regional currency equivalent of US$0,05.” will be charged. Regarding the IMTT, this will be calculated at a rate of 0,02 on every ZiG transaction or part thereof transacted for each transaction on which the tax is payable. “Provided that if a single transaction on which the tax is payable is equivalent to or exceeds the equivalent in Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] of US$500 000 (at the prevailing interbank rate) a flat intermediated money transfer tax of the equivalent in Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] of US$10 150 (at the prevailing interbank rate) shall be chargeable on such transaction,” Ncube continued. The SI stated that Section 36G(2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of 0,02 on every US dollar or part thereof for each transaction on which the tax is payable. “Provided that if a single transaction on which the tax is payable is equivalent to or exceeds US$500 000 a flat intermediated money transfer tax of US$10 150 shall be chargeable on such transaction,” Ncube added. A charge of 0,02 was also levied on every Zimbabwe-gold-backed digital token or part thereof transacted for each transaction on which the tax is payable. "

In the comparative period, the company registered a profit after tax of slightly over ZWL$1 billion. In its latest financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, Fidelity chairman Livingstone Gwata said the group’s insurance contract revenue stood at ZWL$116,6 billion at the end of the period under review, up 242% from 2022. “Inflation adjusted insurance contract revenue recorded a strong growth of 242% compared to the previous year from ZWL$34,1 billion to ZWL$116,6 billion. Historical cost insurance contract revenue grew by 962% compared to prior year from ZWL$4,6 billion to ZWL$48,5 billion,” he said. “The impressive growth in insurance contract revenue was on the back of the group’s innovative product development bearing fruits and increased uptake of the company’s products offering on the market.” The group recorded significant growth in premium inflows through its Vaka Yako product contributing 83% of the individual life premiums. The Zimbabwe operation contributed 62% of the premium inflows, while 38% is attributable to the Malawi operation. The group’s insurance service result increased by 280%, underpinned by the real growth in insurance contract revenue. “This is despite an increase in insurance service expenses propelled by the increase in claims and directly attributable costs due to the inflationary environment prevailing in Zimbabwe and the regional business operation,” Gwata said. Insurance service expenses were recorded at ZWL$34,14 billion at the end of the period under review, from a 2022 comparative ZWL$12,09 billion. The increase in revenue also included a 91% growth in net investment income to nearly ZWL$71 billion, from the 2022 comparative. This was driven by fair value gains from investment property, equities and interest income from money market investments. However, the net change in investment contract liabilities stood at ZWL$81,29 billion during the period, from ZWL$4,86 billion in 2022. “The business remains on high alert to these activities and will continue to monitor and carefully adapt to these changing circumstances to deliver value to its key stakeholders,” Gwata noted. “The business will be preserving its cash wallet through responsible spending and targeted investment into products that survive the test of time. Innovation will be key in also driving the products that create and preserve shareholder and policyholder value.” He said Fidelity’s goal was to leverage on building and delivering sustainable insurance products and services to clients and stakeholders. In terms of assets, these were valued at ZWL$483,77 billion, up nearly 79% from the 2022 comparative, driven by investment properties. Gwata, however, noted that the group needed to strengthen its capital position. "

                     The Top 5 Container Shipping Companies In The World
                    ","Container shipping is at the core of the global economy, with this industry ensuring that goods can flow freely across continents, helping with global commerce and trade. The top shipping companies in this industry are not just transporters. They are, in fact, pivotal to driving international trade, regulations, and economic dynamics. Whether you’re looking for chartering jobs or you’re simply curious to know more about the industry, in this article, we’ll be diving into the top five container shipping companies based on their cargo capacity, fleet size, and industry positioning.    Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC)    Number Of Ships: 800 approximately.    TEU Capacity: 5,614,057    MSC was founded in 1970 and is Swiss-based. It has recently reached the top spot in the global shipping industry with some strategic acquisitions and enhancements to their existing fleet, leading to serious expansion. This aggressive expansion led to the addition of nearly 100 ships, allowing MSC to become a dominant force in the industry. Despite this expansion, however, MSC has a strong focus on green technologies and digitalisation in an attempt to reduce its environmental footprint and improve operational efficiencies to help it to grow even further.    APM-Maersk    Number Of Ships: 675 approximately    TEU Capacity: 4,117,136    Hailing from Denmark, APM-Maersk has long been a frontrunner in the container shipping industry. The company is well-renowned for its size and efforts to improve environmental sustainability not just within its company but within the industry as a whole. Maersk’s pioneering efforts have seen the company make significant strides in integrating green fuel alternatives. They also have already integrated digital solutions into their operations, something that many other container shipping companies aim to replicate.    CMA CGM Group    Number Of Ships: 624 approximately    TEU Capacity: 3,578,494  The French shipping giant CMA CGM Group was established in 1978 and currently holds third position in the standings based on size of the company. Due to the forward-thinking leadership of Jacques Saade, the company has grown significantly through mergers and strategic expansions, which has allowed CMA CGM to operate within 150 shipping routes across the globe. With ecological initiatives being heavily invested in, particularly with the adoption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) the company has long held a commitment to innovation and sustainability.    COSCO Shipping Lines    Number Of Ships: 490 approximately    TEU Capacity: 3,054,323    The China Ocean Shipping Company is more commonly known as COSCO. It is based in China and is one of the biggest conglomerates in the container shipping industry. The company has recently slipped to fourth in the list due to the rise in mergers from CMA CGM, however, COSCO is expected to boost their capacity in the very near future significantly. With an extensive network and digital transformation initiatives, COSCO is set to continue to remain robust in such a competitive market, with many growth plans due to come into existence in the next few years.    Hapag-Lloyd    Number Of Ships: 266 approximately    TEU Capacity: 1,963,934    The German company Hapag-Lloyd is well-known in the industry and comes with a rich history dating all the way back to 1970. The company was born from the merger of Hamburg-American Line and the North German company Lloyd.

                     CBZ to monitor risks to protect 330% profit
                    ","CBZ Holdings Limited (CBZ) will monitor commodity price volatility and El Niño-induced drought risks to strategise faster, after recording a 330% increase in profit after tax in 2023. In its financial year ended December 31, 2023, CBZ recorded an increase in profit in Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL$) terms after tax rose to ZWL$693,56 billion, compared to 2022’s prior figure of ZWL$161,28 billion. The increase was on the back of its non-net interest income soaring to ZWL$1,85 trillion during the period, against the 2022 figure of ZWL$859, 44 billion. However, given global commodity price volatility and El Niño-induced drought this year, CBZ will be closely monitoring the situation to strategise better to protect its gains from 2023. “In 2024, the IMF [International Monetary Fund] expects global growth to remain flat at 3,1%, with the risks to the outlook largely balanced. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to recover to 3,8%,” CBZ’s new chairman Luxon Zembe said, in a statement attached to the group’s annual financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2023. “In Zimbabwe, however, government expects growth to moderate further to 3,5% as the adverse effects of the El Niño effect become more pronounced, particularly on the agricultural and related sectors. Relatively strong performance is, however, still expected in the mining, accommodation and food services, and wholesale and retail trade sectors.” He continued: “The downside risks to the growth projections include, among others, prolonged weak commodity prices, especially for base metals and PGMs, potential further disruptions to supply chains and trade flows, and currency weaknesses.” “The Group will continue to monitor these developments for quicker detection of, and response to, emerging risks and opportunities,” he concluded. Driving the non-net interest income were unrealised gains on foreign currency exchange, fair value adjustments on investment properties owing to the foreign currency increases, commission and income and net income from forex trading. However, as the now defunct Zimdollar depreciated by over 700% last year, CBZ’s operating expenditure more than doubled to over ZWL$1 trillion, from a 2022 comparative of ZWL$412,39 billion. This was driven by increases in staff and administrative costs. “The board seeks to strike a balance between the need to provide competitive financial returns and the expectations of stakeholders and shareholders regarding governance in the context of growing change and regulatory complexity,” Zembe said. “The board has done a commendable job of establishing the Group’s strategic direction and making sure the Group successfully manages risk. Our primary emphasis continues to be setting measurable goals to support a positive company culture that is in line with our steadfast dedication to our stakeholders.” Net interest income was recorded at ZWL$547,76 billion during the period under review, up nearly 55% from the 2022 comparative. In terms of loans and advances to customers, CBZ recorded a near 145% increase to ZWL$2,07 trillion during the period from a 2022 comparative of ZWL$846,79 billion. Commercial loans to the private sector, agriculture, mining, manufacturing and distribution drove lending. “The extension of the multi-currency system to 2030 provided the much-needed policy clarity and consistency for the given period, thereby enabling the Group to effectively underwrite long term products,” Zembe said. “The Group also continued to leverage on its strong investment in intellectual, manufactured, and financial capital to continuously develop and offer solutions that satisfy the needs of its wide range of clients. These included, among others, enhancement of products and mobilisation of external lines of credit to better meet the loan requirements of industry.” Deposits rose to ZWL5,57 trillion as at the end of the period under review, from a 2022 comparative of ZWL3,26 trillion. Increased lending and financial securities helped grow CBZ’s total assets to ZWL8,25 trillion at the end of last year, an increase of nearly 80% from 2022. "

                     ZCTU mourns over low wages
                    ","THE Zimbabwe Congress Trade Union (ZCTU) secretary-general Japhet Moyo has encouraged national employment councils (NECs) to come up with wage minimums in line with the cost of living. This follows increasing complaints from workers that wages are not being raised in line with the cost of living, after the country’s former currency, the Zimdollar (ZWL$), lost over 700% of its value last year, which prompted workers to demand to be paid in line with inflation, pegged against the greenback. The NEC for the Commercial Sectors of Zimbabwe has since thus raised wages so that the lowest-paid employee takes home US$295 or its Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) equivalent, from US$253. “We encourage parties to make sure they agree on a living wage or wages and salaries above the PDL (poverty datum line),” Moyo said, in an interview with NewsDay Business. At US$295, the cost of living for one person translates to nearly ZiG4 000 using the official forex rate. Last week, the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency reported the Total Consumption Poverty Line for one person was ZiG650,26 in April 2024. For food, the costs for one person was recorded at ZiG424,95 based on a low calorie diet. However, most of the economy uses the much higher forex rates prevalent on the parallel market. “This is a collective bargaining agreement for the commercial industry. This was entered or agreed by the registered employer organisation and registered trade union in the commercial sector,” Moyo said. “NECs enjoy delegated powers, therefore, it is within their powers to determine minimum conditions of employment and wages within their sector. The parties to the NECs are answerable to their members who mandate them regularly to negotiate or review wages and salaries.” He accused NECs of failing to represent workers fully and that workers felt betrayed. “Over the years very few parties at the various NECs have managed to agree on wages and salaries above the PDL,” Moyo said. Meanwhile, the Public Service Labour and Social Welfare ministry has cancelled the registration certificate of the NEC for food and allied industry for failing to submit audited financial statements for the year 2023 to date. The move, according to analysts, will have a domino effect on NECs that have not complied with the Labour Amendment section 56 as well. “It is hereby notified that I as the Acting Registrar of Labour, has in terms of section 59 (4) as read with section 63A of the Labour Act [Chapter 28:01] cancelled the registration certificate of National Employment Council for the food and allied industry with immediate effect,” the ministry said, in a letter dated April 22, 2024. “For avoidance of doubt section 59 (4) provides as follows: An employment council shall submit an audited account of its revenue and expenditure to the Registrar within the period specified in section 63; and; submit at the written request of the Registrar, no later than seven days after receiving the request, or after such longer period as the Registrant may for good cause allow, such written report on any matter as the Registrar may reasonably require in connection with its operations.” The letter indicated that any failure on the part of the employment council to comply with those requirements constitutes justifiable grounds for the registrar to cancel a certificate. “National Employment Council for food and allied industries has not submitted audited financial statements for the year 2023 to date as such I have cancelled your registration certificate with immediate effect. Please be advised accordingly,” the letter added. "

                     ‘Entrepreneurs need to enter into alliances’
                    ","BUY Zimbabwe founder Munyaradzi Hwengwere says entrepreneurs need to enter into economic alliances to improve Zimbabwe’s economy. Speaking at an entrepreneurial business seminar last week called: Expanding Opportunities Through Meet-ups, which was aimed at encouraging networking between start-up business owners and entrepreneurs, Hwengwere said young people needed to be trustworthy to expand their networks. “We have young people who have realised the power of networks, but instead of getting frustrated about it, they have decided to come together and become the network itself. There is a need for us to realise the opportunities that come with networks and leverage on the opportunities in Zimbabwe and across the world towards success and improve the ecosystems of the economy in Zimbabwe,” Hwengwere said during the event which was organised Yarutso Car Rentals and Yarutso Adventure founder, Victor Madzedze. “There is a need to improve attitude, eagerness and the ability to fulfil promises, which are the fundamentals of competence in networking. Humility must walk together with intelligence, focus, hard work and trust and this is one of the challenges most young people have that they are not willing to learn and that leads to arrogance.” He urged young people to be humble enough to learn from those more experienced to expand networks and ecosystems. Chief executive officer of Qupa Micro-finance — an entity under ZB Financing Holdings Limited — Jade Tsokodayi said entrepreneurs must utilise all sources of financing around them when starting businesses. The CEO noted that this would avoid the debt crises that come with borrowing from micro-financing institutions. Tsokodayi encouraged entrepreneurs to establish their businesses first before approaching micro financing institutions. “So, for financing, do not look further than yourself, you need to make sure that you redeem all and everything around you. When you are more established you then approach micro-finance institutions like us. When you are still starting, the cost of financing could be exorbitant and you might end up in debt instead of flourishing as a business,” he said. “When starting, utilise family, friends and the fools around you. So many people are so successful due to their uncles who had money. Some are up there because they had friends who were well established, and some are successful because they had fools out there with the money, but without ideas.” He encouraged small businesses to bank their money so that they have traceable financial statements that are necessary when one needs to get financing from micro-finance institutions for capital. Tsokodayi also said entrepreneurs should see micro-finance institutions as partners rather than loan sharks. “If you borrow, please pay for you to maintain relationships with these financial institutions. Remember, if you are a bad creditor, you are blacklisted from getting any form of financing. This is a form of professionalism that any business needs and when it gets to a point that you are blacklisted, being successful will be very hard,” he said. “When you are confident that you are established, you come to us, and we will take you through every process to proper financing. We will need you to put all your financial statements on the table. We have realised that most people are missing out on basic financial services because they do not bank their money.” Tsokodayi urged entrepreneurs to have several lines of income to sustain their businesses, while embracing networking in their business plans in the process. “When establishing your businesses, never rely on one source of income. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. When you decide to be an entrepreneur, never lose focus and the reason why you started in the first place. Networking is also the key to success,” he added. "

                     African Sun flush with cash for capital investments
                    ","HOSPITALITY group, African Sun Limited (ASL), has planned major capital investments into refurbishments of its properties and upscaling its information technology for the year amid a projected increase in business. The commitment comes after the firm increased its capital commitments last year to US$11,01 million, up 20,22% on the 2022 figures. Funding for these capital investments is expected to come from normal operating cash flows and debt finance, as the firm entered the year in a liquid position with a current ratio of 1,76. In a statement accompanying its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, ASL chairman Constantine Chikosi said they were expecting robust business from growing demand for meetings, incentives, conferencing and events. “While macroeconomic uncertainty around inflation and currency instability persists, we are fortunate to have the liquidity and financial flexibility to make prudent investments, aligning with our vision of ensuring a seamless and enjoyable guest experience,” he said. “During 2024, we have planned significant capital investments into enabling information technology and further hotel refurbishments. These investments set the stage for a sustainable growth trajectory for the group and enhanced returns for our shareholders.” Chikosi said the group was engaging financiers to support its capital commitments for the year. “The group is currently in discussions with leading financial institutions to secure funding to complement its healthy cash balances for deployment in carrying out accelerated material hotel refurbishment projects,” he revealed. The group’s improved liquidity position comes as it is operating free of debt, recording cash and cash equivalents of US$10,87 million as of the end of last year, although this was 5% below the 2022 buffer. Chikosi said the cash deployment strategy last year mainly focused on completing targeted hotel refurbishments to enhance guest experience. “During the period under review, we continued to prioritise strategic capital allocation initiatives,” he said. “This included the completion of the refurbishment of the remaining 46 rooms at Hwange Safari Lodge and the refurbishment of the public areas which is progressing well. The refurbishment of the public areas at Troutbeck and the Great Zimbabwe conference centre was also completed during the period under review.” However, the group’s operating and other expenses remain a threat to profitability as these rose by a combined 38,18% last year. Chikosi attributed the increase to exchange rate volatility, inflationary pressures and the crystallisation of expenses in US dollars as the economy increased the dollarisation pace. Such challenges saw the firm’s income tax expense also expand to US$2,09 million during the period under review, from nearly US$592 000 in 2022. Profit after tax from continuing operations dropped by 93,14% to US$521 045 in the period under review, from US$7,6 million in 2022. “The group will continue to monitor costs and implement various cost-saving initiatives,” Chikosi said. Increased revenue of US$54,73 million, up 30% against the comparable period, managed to keep the group from entering into a loss-making position, he said. “The improved performance was driven by firmer average daily rates which closed 2023 at US$110, an increase of 39% against US$79 achieved during the comparable period as a result of changes in customer mix,” Chikosi said. “Hotel occupancies increased to 52%, 6 percentage points above 2022. Revenue per available room for accommodation revenue increased by 58% to US$57, up from US$36 in the comparative period.” Total assets rose to US$142,33 million during the period under review, from a 2022 comparative of US$121,52 million. This was driven by an increase in the rights of use of assets, the lessee’s right to occupy, operate, or hold a leased asset during the rental period. "

                    ","VICTORIA Falls Stock Exchange-listed WestProp Holdings Limited yesterday began the development of the US$300 million Hills Luxury Golf Estate as its urban renewal push intensifies. Apart from the construction of the world class golf course, the development will see the construction of villas, apartments, townhouses, country club, hotel, tennis and swimming academy and a shopping mall. The golf course will be modelled after an 18-hole golf course used in the PGA Tour. “Today’s launch, which will continue with the groundbreaking, starts the development of the rebranded Hills Luxury Estate, formerly known as Warren Hills Golf Club, into a mixed live, work, shop and play luxury lifestyle estate,” WestProp chief executive officer Ken Sharpe said yesterday. “This is part of our contribution to the urban renewal projects as endorsed by the second republic. We are creating value of over US$300 million through this project. We are confident that by the time it is completed, the value of the investment of this project will have grown substantially.” He said that the project would add 70 million bricks to their target of one billion bricks by 2050. “This project that we are undertaking today is a legacy project. It brings many firsts for sub-Saharan Africa and to Zimbabwe. I believe this project will forever change perceptions of Harare and Zimbabwe,” Sharpe added. “We are on a mission to make sure that one billion bricks are put in the ground by 2050 on all our projects and that includes Pokugara Residential Estate, Millennium Heights, Pomona City and the Hills Golf Estate. This project is going to consume an estimated 70 million bricks. So, this project alone will double our bricks to take us to over 150 million, almost 15% of the vision being realised.” WestProp roped in renowned golf course designer Peter Matkovich and top  architect Joan Balagué Capdet to the project. “It is with great privilege that I welcome Joan Balagué Capdet. He flew in all the way yesterday from Barcelona, Spain. He is the man who designed this beautiful estate that we are unveiling today. He came up with a concept plan. His first time walking on this land was about two years ago,” Sharpe noted. “He was involved and instrumental in doing the town plan to incorporate this mixed-use development into a smart city, where we have on the walls around your beautiful pictures of what it is that is being designed. He designed the homes.”  Sharpe said Matkovich will create an 18-hole world championship golf course. “Peter came to see me a few years ago, he said to me, I not only designed the best golf courses in Africa and have won the most awards for the best golf courses, but I  am also a man of the soil of Zimbabwe,” Sharpe said. “He was born in Zimbabwe and he wanted to come back to Zimbabwe and leave his legacy, his mark in his later years on the best course that he has designed.” Apart from this development, others WestProp projects include the Millennium Heights which is ongoing, Pokugara Residential Estate, Pomona City (ongoing), The Mall of Zimbabwe and Millennium Heights Office Park.

                     Watch ZiG closely: Fews Net
                    ","FOOD security initiative, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fews Net), says the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency will have to be tracked regularly to see its sustainability, amid worsening living conditions. Last month saw the introduction of the ZiG, replacing the battered Zimdollar that had experienced a sharp depreciation. In its latest food security update for April, Fews Net said households were expected to increase their reliance on coping strategies to meet their food needs due to the poor harvest and inflation. This comes as Zimbabwe’s 2023/24 agricultural season is in the midst of suffering from the El Niño-induced drought, leading to a state of national disaster being declared on April 3, last month. “On April 5, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe introduced a new local currency, the Zimbabwe Gold. The structured currency, which is said to be backed by gold and other precious minerals and foreign currency reserves, was pegged at 1 ZiG to ZWL$2 499 (previous currency) and 13,56 ZiG to US$1 when launched,” Fews Net said. “By mid-April, electronic and mobile money platforms had adjusted to the new currency, while ZiG notes and coins became available from April 30. It will be critical to continue monitoring the markets following the establishment of a new currency.” The uncertainty of ZiG has caused businesses and retailers to offer different forex exchange rates ranging from US$1:ZiG14 to ZiG16. Officially, the forex rate is US$1:ZiG13,43. Fews Net noted how the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency had started a new data series for monitoring the poverty datum lines using the ZiG. The national average Food Poverty Datum Line per person per month for April was assessed to be ZiG425 and the average total consumption poverty line at ZiG650. Fews Net said the increased reliance on coping strategies by households will be driven by the poor harvest, limited seasonal agricultural labour opportunities, and high food prices. This is expected to drive area-level crisis outcomes in typical deficit-producing areas in the south, east, west, and extreme north into the post-harvest period. “In typical surplus-producing parts of the Mashonaland provinces and other areas, stressed (IPC Phase 2) area-level outcomes are anticipated to emerge as the poor harvest, limited crop sales and increased competition for income-earning opportunities affect household purchasing power, with some poor households likely to engage in coping strategies indicative of crisis (IPC Phase 3) to meet their food needs,” Fews Net said.

                     Zim to achieve zero tariffs by 2035
                    ","THE Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC) says 97% of the country’s tariff lines will go to zero by 2035, as it urged local companies to prepare themselves to trade under the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA). This comes amid revelations that about a third of the local manufacturers are ready to compete in the AfCFTA. The AfCFTA is an initiative that was adopted by the African Union to drive intra-African trade, thereby boosting economies on the continent. According to CTC, under the protocol of trade, member states of the AfCFTA are expected to reduce and eventually eliminate tariffs to boost intra-African trade. To do that, AfCFTA member states are to propose tariff liberalisation schedules which most nations have been slow to implement as it would lower the tax revenue. Zimbabwe’s tariff liberalisation schedule has 6 606 total tariff lines, which have been categorised as categories A, B, and C. Category A is the non-sensitive list which has 5 956 tariff lines, category B is the sensitive list which has 455 tariff lines, and category C is the exclusive list which has 195 tariff lines. Zimbabwe resubmitted its final tariffs order for technical verification to the AfCFTA secretariat to enter the second phase of the guided trade initiatives, which pilots preferential trade between member states. “It is not that we are exactly late, but it is a process where the government of Zimbabwe helps us make the tariff offers to submit to the AfCFTA secretariat,” CTC economist Tawanda Katsande told NewsDay Business in an interview. “We submitted our first offer in 2022 and we got some comments, and we were addressing the comments. Now, the official position is that we have again sent the revised version offer to the AfCfTA secretariat and we are awaiting to receive comments from them again, so we move forward.” Katsande said Zimbabwe will start implementing the tariff offers when the verification process is complete. “When we complete this verification process and we gazette the AfCFTA offer, that is when we start to gazette the phase downs according to the categories,” he said. “So, if you count correctly, the first phase down will be in 2025 and the second will be in 2035. But eventually, 97% of our tariff lines will go to zero tariffs by 2035. “The industry needs to understand this to prepare themselves for AfCFTA and to know which category their products fall in. So, the tariff offer we were talking about has three categories.” Katsande said the AfCFTA would be of much benefit to the local industries as it offered a bigger market and allowed the movement of goods duty-free. However, the duty-free movement is only if the products are produced completely through the county’s own raw materials. “We are already trading in Comesa, in Sadc, Ecowas, and AfCFTA is just increasing the market in the region,” Katsande said. The push to participate in the AfCFTA comes as countries seek to get more value from a market with combined gross domestic product of over US$3,4 trillion. "

In its latest quarterly report, Zimplats stated that most of its projects for the period under review progressed as planned. The Bimha and Mupani mine development and upgrade projects will replace production from Rukodzi, and Ngwarati and Mupfuti mines. Cumulatively, US$395 million had been spent on these projects as at March 31, 2024, against a total project budget of US$468 million. The firm spent US$340 million on the smelter expansion and SO2 abatement plant against a total project budget of US$521 million. The report noted that US$27 million had been spent on the implementation of the 35 megawatts solar plant project to date, against a budget of US$37 million.  The company also expended US$27 million on the execution of the Base Metal Refinery refurbishment project, against a total budget of US$190 million. The projects are part of Zimplats’ US$1,8 billion expansion programme. In light of the softer metal pricing environment, management implemented various cash preservation measures which included labour rationalisation and capital project re-scheduling within cash constraints. In April, 67 employees, being 1,6% of total permanent workforce, were retrenched.    “Cost containment initiatives implemented in the quarter prior progressed in the period under review, resulting in a 2% reduction in total operating cash costs from the prior quarter,” the report read in part. “Operating cash costs increased by 7% year-on-year, primarily due to the 9% and 7% increase in mining and milling volumes respectively, benefiting from cost mitigation efforts which helped contain the impact of persistent input inflation.” The focus of exploration activities in the period under review was the geotechnical logging of the core drilled at Ngezi (ML37) and updating the group’s geological and mineral resource models with the assay results received. Mining volumes were unchanged from prior quarter but increased by 9% year-on-year benefiting from the pillar reclamation operations at Rukodzi Mine and the continued ramp-up of production from Mupani Mine, which is under development. Pillar reclamation activities also benefited 6E (platinum, palladium, rhodium, gold, ruthenium and iridium) head grade, which was 2% higher year-on-year. The 1% reduction in grade from the prior quarter was due to an increased contribution of lower-grade Mupani Mine development ore and dilution from mining across geological structures. Milled volumes increased by 7% and 3% from the comparative and prior quarter, respectively. The report showed that a scheduled reline of the mills at the Selous Metallurgical Complex was deferred to the fourth quarter of financial year 2024, the volumes from which also benefited from improved milling rates and running time, in line with higher ore supply. Concentrate recoveries were stable versus the prior quarter and increased by 5% from the comparative quarter, resulting in a 2% quarter-on-quarter and 14% year-on-year increase in the volume of 6E in concentrate produced. 6E metal in final product improved by 12% year-on-year and was 1% higher than the prior quarter. Transfers from stocks to operating costs amounted to US$2,8 million during the period, in line with the movement in inventory across the value chain. Cash costs of metal produced increased by 5% and 1% from the comparative and prior quarter, respectively. Operating cash unit cost of US$821 per 6E ounce was marginally below that of the prior quarter and declined by 6% year-on-year, benefiting from volume gains which offset inflationary pressures experienced on electricity.  ministries and with stakeholders from the private and non-profit sectors,” the bank said "

Econet has partnered with its sister company, Sasai Money Transfer, to enable individuals and companies in the United Kingdom and South Africa to send money into Zimbabwe free of charge, starting today (May 2, 2024). The receiver also cashes out of their EcoCash wallet for free.  International remittances attract a charge of up to 15% for the sender, while the receiver is charged 3% when cashing-out.  Econet Wireless Zimbabwe chief executive, Douglas Mboweni explained that the latest decision is aimed at helping Zimbabweans to weather the acute challenges caused by the drought.  The country recently declared a national disaster over a drought caused by the climate event known as El Niño, which has left more than 2.7 million people in need of food aid.  “We hope Zimbabweans in the Diaspora will use the savings to send more money home to their families,” Mboweni said.  “The majority of remittances to Zimbabwe are conducted through these two main corridors (the UK and South Africa). We don’t have to pay any third parties on those corridors, because we rely on a sister company in the group, which agreed to help out,” he said. He said he hopes the move by Econet will encourage other companies facilitating remittances into Zimbabwe to reduce their fees, noting that it was time that remittances into Africa in general were brought down “to assist with the continent’s economic development agenda”.  Mboweni  added  that the initiative was in support of government efforts to increase diaspora remittances coming into the country through formal channels. Econet's extensive EcoCash agent network ensures that even people in remote rural areas have access to low-cost financial services, reducing the need for recipients to travel long distances to collect cash. Econet said Remittance transfers will be facilitated through the EcoCash US dollar wallet, which is accessible by dialling *153# on an EcoCash registered Econet line.  Senders in the UK and South Africa can access Sasai Money Transfer by downloading the Sasai Money Transfer App on the Google Play Store and on the App Store.

Operational and financial resilience is of paramount importance to the bank supported by robust business continuity and succession planning arrangements.” Chipunza said the bank recorded comprehensive income of ZWL$230,5 billion in the year under review from ZWL$132,3 billion in 2022. During the period under review, the bank posted a monetary gain of ZWL$77,23 billion translating to an increase of nearly 1 666% compared to the prior year. The gain was driven by the exchange rate volatility when the now defunct Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL) depreciated by over 700% in 2023. This depreciation also saw the bank make a fair value gain on investment property to ZWL$271,51 billion, from ZWL$146,8 billion in the comparative 2022 period. Thus, total net income was recorded at ZWL$261,84 billion, but kept down by a net interest expense of ZWL$20,3 billion. Loans and advances to customers dropped by nearly 82% during the period under review to ZWL$3,08 billion, from the prior year as the bank cut back on ZWL loans. Chipunza said the revaluation gains of the bank’s investment property portfolio was because of strategic actions by Metbank to hedge its balance sheet against exchange rate and inflationary pressures. This revaluation propelled the bank’s total assets to ZWL$787,01 billion during the period under review, up 67,5% on the 2022 comparative. “The bank remained compliant with the revised regulatory minimum capital requirements for commercial banks, and the bank is pleased that it has continued to grow its capital base well beyond the minimum thresholds,” Chipunza said. “Going forward, the bank’s capitalisation will continue to be driven through organic growth with any anticipated shortfalls being covered through shareholder injections.” However, a threat to the bank’s profitability remains its expenses as operating expenditure more than tripled to ZWL$102,12 billion during the period under review from 2022. Administrative expenses were the main driver behind the increase. “The operating environment remains challenging, but we remain optimistic that the bank will maintain an upward growth trajectory, anchored by its strong statement of its financial position,” Chipunza said. “In the implementation of the bank’s strategy for the delivery of unique customer value propositions, innovation and digitalisation remain our core objectives. Metbank will continue to engage all the relevant funding partners in raising long-term capital to support the country’s economic development aspirations.” Deposits for the period under review, rose 146% to ZWL$64,36 billion from the 2022 comparative.

A distinguished fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (UK), Chinyemba replaced David Brown, who stepped down in August 2021 as group CEO for KMH. Prior to that, Chinyemba was KMH chief operating officer. “He is leaving KMH for Mutapa as chief investment officer,” a reliable source told NewsDay Business. “Under his leadership, defunct mines were resuscitated and turned into profitable ventures. These include Zimbabwe Alloys, Shamva and Sandawana, among others.” Under Chinyemba’s strategy to streamline operations and decentralise decision making, the diversified mining group last year restructured its operations into four main clusters — gold, energy,  platinum group minerals (PGMs) and bulk metals. The strategy set the mining firm on a growth path and enhanced its resilience. Within the energy cluster there is Bindura Nickel Corporation and Sandawana, the gold  cluster has Shamva Mine, Jena Mine and Freda Rebecca, bulk metals cluster has Zim Alloys with Great Dyke Investments making up the PGMs cluster. Each cluster is headed by a team of technocrats, with many years’ experience in the mining sectors. Chinyemba had plans to list the company on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange. In addition, he pushed for gender parity in the traditionally male-dominated mining business by insisting on a quota for women working for KMH. The mining giant participated actively in community-based corporate social responsibility initiatives during his stint at the helm. KMH holds some of Zimbabwe’s best mining assets. The mining firm is now under Mutapa, Zimbabwe’s state sovereign wealth fund. Efforts to get a comment from KMH and Chinyemba were fruitless. "

                     Inaugural Vinyl Festival prepares to launch
                    ","ARTS promoter and curator Eleni Athikati has announced that she will be hosting the first ever Vinyl Festival in Zimbabwe at Ella the Garden in Newlands, Harare from Tuesday May 21 to 26. Athikati, who was born in Zimbabwe and raised in South Africa and Greece, told NewsDay Life & Style that the vinyl record was almost becoming extinct, yet it is the most trustworthy memory bank of Zimbabwean folk and musical history. A vinyl record or a phonograph record (also known as a gramophone record, especially in British English) is described as an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. Most Zimbabwean music was recorded and stored on a vinyl record and would be played on a radiogram. Fused sungura band Bantu Spaceship whose music was recently recorded on vinyl will headline the Vinyl Festival which has lined up several local, regional and international vinyl DJs. “I have been organising arts events in the garden including Katikitiki Space since 2010 when I came back to Zimbabwe from Greece and identified lots of gaps in the arts industry of which some can be collectively solved. “Artistes have in most cases lamented the misrepresentations by middlemen and artistes can now market and speak for themselves from the Garden and Katikitiki Space,” Athikati told NewsDay Life & Style. “The Vinyl Festival in Zimbabwe will take place at the Ella Garden in Newlands in Harare from Tuesday May 21 to 26. Katikitiki Space will be our main stage and it will mainly be Vinyl DJs, including a performance from the Bantu Spaceship band.” There are many reasons advanced as to why the vinyl record was phased out or became scarce on the market. Athikati believes that the coming of the compact disc, which was more conveniently played on a cheaper play back device was one reason among many others, which include but are not limited to shelving of antiquated vinyl disc cutting machines and the arrival of digitised forms like MP3, mini disc and solely digital discographies. The vinyl can further be described as an analog audio recording pressed in vinyl. The 45 revolutions per minute (RPM) record holds one song per side, while 33 1/3 RPM and long play (LP) record holds an entire album. Athikati clarified that on May 21 there will be a Vinyl Fest launch which will mainly be characterised by meeting and greeting. All evenings will be musical events which feature local and international vinyl DJs, while in the afternoons experts and academics in the music industry will conduct workshops. “Wednesday May 22 afternoon from 12-4pm, there will be a turntable workshop on vinyl and new music hosted by @nyauist (CPT) and Fabian Freedom Youth (CPT) and in the evening 17:00-20:00 hours listening session plus discussion with @bikoemcee; Professor Joosty on Vinyls and Sound System Culture (UK/JHB). “Thursday May 23, 12:00-16:00 there will be Turning Tables 2 DJ Lab workshop hosted by DJ Lua and Farakataza on Women and Vinyl History and in the evening 18:00-20:00 Scratch: Documentary screening and discussion by Tomas Brickhill and Shade of a Woman,” She highlighted. The Gramma Records which housed Zimbabwe Music Corporation and the Record and Tape Promotions was the major supplier of vinyl records in Zimbabwe. Afro-fusion band Mokoomba has also in the recent past made recordings sold on vinyl in Europe, Athikati said. She also mentioned that the Katikitiki Space has a public address system and band kit which has been specifically reserved for small bands which can manage their performances at very low volumes.   "

He has since grown in his music to reflect on his personal life and surroundings. The 19-year-old musician, who has relocated from Zaka, Masvingo province to Budiriro, in Harare, told Newsday Life & Style that his musical journey dates back to 2018, but his song writing skills were not good enough back then because he could only get ideas for songs from events affecting humanity on a larger scale. “I used to sing about natural disasters and pandemics. I have realised my music has evolved which has allowed me to be creative while reflecting on my life and surroundings. Growing up listening to music of the late Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi and Prince Musarurwa became my musical influences,” Chirombedze said. The budding musician said he was privileged to have a father who had a background and passion in the arts industry, specifically entertainment. “Having my father’s backup, who has a background in the entertainment industry, worked in my favour. He once worked for the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation around 2011, while managing musicians and organising shows for the likes of Charles Charamba and Blessing Shumba. This helped me to get the support of my father.” he added. The musician is set to launch his debut seven-track album titled Godo Ramuinaro at Harare Sports Club on June 15. The album consists of Godo Ramuinaro, the title track, Mwana Haasi Wangu, Zvichaita Riini, Chiedza, Jenaguru, Mudiwa Ever and Makorokoto.

In a wide-ranging interview with NewsDay Life & Style Rushambwa said the selected artworks would be showcased in Shanghai, China, from May 25 to 30. “Painters should submit a canvas portrait of 80cm by 60cm on a selected theme of their choice from their portfolios that either address clean water and sanitation, wildlife protection, education, love for life and nature or Sino-Zim relationships. “The winning and approved selected artists shall sign a licensing agreement for their work with CZEC,” Rushambwa explained. The competition is a fundraiser whose proceeds shall be channelled towards charity organisations in Zimbabwe which spearhead community development projects. “We observed that there are limited means of sourcing funds; as such we came up with a competition or facility whereby artists from the communities can seed their paintings towards community development and CZEC will exhibit them at the forthcoming African Charity Fundraiser Competition in Shanghai, China this May 25 to 30. “The artists stand a chance of partaking in future invitations to China for their own exhibitions or cultural exchange programmes. Once the paintings are sold, an honest transaction will be channelled towards the home town or city or the artist’s place of choice for developing issues and concerns like borehole drilling, schools and road construction, housing development, scholarships, stationery supplies, wild life preservation, tree planting and community gardens. “Our extensive marketing has in the past yielded business leads for the artists. As testimonies to this we have the likes of the late Antony Bumbira, Batsirai Muskwe and Hope Mafeko. The artists except for Bumhira have since chosen projects of their choice in their communities. The names of the artists who seed their artworks shall be inscribed on the walls of all the developmental projects which are funded through the proceeds from their artworks,” he clarified. Rushambwa also revealed that their organisation is prioritising continued education and responsible citizenship for the artists and the youths. “We need to increase the market share for the Zimbabwean creative work, while observing and being wary of patents and copyright protection. Our organisation is highly involved in youth activities that enable citizens who love their communities. Likewise artists shall receive further training in their various capacities,” he added.

Nleya, who started the country’s first multimedia exhibition in 2017 with very few attendees, told NewsDay Life & Style that the number of people attending has increased over the years, attracting exhibitors from countries such as Germany and the United Arab Emirates. “I got inspiration to start multi-media exhibitions because the country needs to broadcast even better. I noticed that there are a lot of opportunities in the country, for example there was no college that trained professional audio in the country and I found an academy called Audio Academy and there were no exhibitions for multimedia then I started one,” he said. Nleya mentioned that it is not advisable to enter an oversubscribed sector, but one should start something new and make a difference to help to develop the country. The sound engineer will hold the third edition of the multi-media exhibition on June 26 and 27 dubbed Audio & Visual Expo under the theme Innovate to Elevate: Enhancing Creativity and Entrepreneurship at Nelson Mandela Hall, Harare Showgrounds. The expo will accommodate exhibitors from various industries including sound PA systems technology, broadcasting (radio and television), cameras, drone technology, lighting technology and multi-media technology, among others. Nleya said feedback from the previous editions of the event was encouraging. The expo provides a platform to grow the local showbiz scene and also helps many industry stakeholders to find and discover business opportunities through exposure, workshops and interactions with exhibitors. The event is open to anyone who works or has interest in the entertainment technology industry.

                    ","SHOWMAX, an African streaming service, has announced that MaBlerh will host The Real Housewives of Durban reunion for the second year in a row. MaBlerh has become the first African to host multiple reunions of The Real Housewives franchise, including The Real Housewives of Gqeberha S1 and The Real Housewives of Johannesburg S3. The Season 4 finale of The Real Housewives of Durban dropped on April 24 and to no one’s surprise, it broke the internet and became the number-one trending topic in South Africa. After an eventful and dramatic season, the ladies had their final dinner on their trip to Namibia, where they confronted each other about things that had been happening in their circle. The confrontations resulted in the ladies splitting into two core groups. On the one side were Sorisha Naidoo, Slee Ndlovu and newcomers Ameigh Thompson and Angel Ndlela. On the other side, Jojo Robinson, Maria Valaskatzis, Nonku Williams and newcomer Zama Ngcobo, with the ladies from each camp not seeing eye-to-eye, viewers have a lot of unanswered questions. The drama is far from over, as Showmax will be airing the reunion in two parts on May 15 and May 22. “I know how heavily invested the audience is in The Real Housewives of Durban, which is why I can never go in there and be flippant,” MaBlerh said. “There are people who wake up at midnight to watch the show, so I know that I must take it seriously and deliver on all fronts. I am honoured to be breaking the record for an African host and I’m excited to be back for the second time: it’s going to be a more comfortable experience for the ladies because we now have a rapport.” MaBlerh has promised viewers that he is not going to leave any stone unturned. “When I approached the reunion last year, it was different. Things were very heated, and the ladies were barely speaking to one another, so I had to be very sensitive and aware of everything that had happened. “With Season 4, it is going to be different because it is not the same season, but I am still going to get to the bottom of things, and I will hold the ladies accountable for the things they have said and done.” MaBlerh said he was there to represent the audience, who have made the show successful. “I am there to represent the viewers. I have been watching the tweets, I have been watching the concerns and comments and, trust me, all of those things will be addressed. I do not operate in a vacuum,” he said. “I watch, and after every episode, I am on social media looking at what the sentiment is. If you have tweeted under the hashtag #RHODurban, your concerns will be covered.” The Let it Rain Films’ executive producer Sam Kelly said they had chosen MaBlerh because he was a big fan of The Real Housewives franchise and had a very deep connection with the Durban franchise. “MaBlerh is a fantastic host and he did a spectacular job last season; he managed to tackle the themes with the grace and sensitivity they needed,” Kelly said. “On why people need to watch the reunion, Kelly said: “It has been a crazy season and the reunion will be your chance to understand all sides of the story. You will see things from everyone’s perspective.” The first season of The Real Housewives of Durban set a then-record on Showmax for the most first-day views and went on to be released in 28 territories outside Africa on Hayu, Peacock and Bravo, the original home of The Real Housewives franchise. Seasons 2 and 3 were among the 10 most-streamed titles on Showmax in their launch years and are currently streaming on Hayu. Meanwhile, the second season of The Real Housewives of Nairobi is set to premiere on Showmax on May 10 with new episodes every Friday. The Real Housewives of Nairobi follows the lives of the most stylish, opulent and hardworking women in Kenya as they navigate their relationships and careers.

                    ","THE Deaf Arts National Culture Entertainment (Dance) has raised concern over the challenges its members are facing in accessing healthcare in Zimbabwe. The organisation identified some of the challenges as shortages of interpreters whenever they visit healthcare centres. Dance projects manager Tsungirirai Tsikira said rigorous efforts must be made to deal with the challenges facing the hearing impaired community. She was speaking as Dance prepares for its third show in Bulawayo and fifth in Zimbabwe with the stage production expected to amplify an awareness message and advocacy for the challenges the hearing impaired community faces at healthcare facilities. “Our project is called The Silent Stage because what we say from the stage you will not be hearing anything and the only thing that you will hear will be voices of the interpreters seated in the audience,” Tsikira said. “The programme that we are running is called Celebrating deaf culture: A journey of theatrical inclusion and empowerment. It is about empowering the deaf community through theatre and it is a first in Zimbabwe to have a deaf drama group.” The production will be spreading the message through a performance so that others can understand the challenges the deaf community faces. “Through powerful storytelling and compelling performances, the production sheds light on the profound impact of interpreter shortages on accessibility and understanding in healthcare. “This is made possible through the help of sign language interpreters who will be voicing everything that will be said on stage. “With each performance, the team behind The Missing Bridge demonstrates an unwavering commitment to fostering empathy and understanding for deaf individuals’ experiences.” Tsikira said recent engagements at prestigious events such as the Shangano Arts Festival in Hwange and the heartfelt reception in Beitbridge had reinforced the importance of the ongoing dialogue. Tsikira said they were thrilled to see the impact The Missing Bridge had during the tour of Zimbabwe. “Our journey has been one of growth and impact, and we are grateful for the opportunity to continue sharing these important stories with audiences across the country,” she said. Dance will be taking its production to the Midlands province as it spreads the message across the country. “Looking ahead, The Missing Bridge has set its sights on Gweru for its next stop towards the end of May. With the support of Culture Fund CreativeActions2 and the EU delegation to Zimbabwe, the production remains committed to its mission of provoking thought and inspiring action towards a more inclusive society,” she added.

Worldwide, almost one third (27%) of women aged 15-49 years who have been in relationships report that they have been subjected to some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner,” the report established. The report further noted that violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health and may increase the risk of acquiring HIV in some settings. The report also indicated that these forms of violence lead to depression, post-traumatic stress disorders, sleep difficulties, eating disorders and suicide attempts while an analysis carried out by the organisation also revealed that women who experienced intimate partner violence are almost twice likely to experience depression and problem drinking. “Sexual violence, particularly during childhood can lead to increased smoking, substance use and risky sexual behaviours.

In the face of spiralling piracy of films, television shows, music, software, literary works and other creative content, African economies, Zimbabwe not excluded, are losing millions of dollars in revenue. “Current estimates put the global cost of content piracy at US$71 billion each year and this amount grows each year as content pirates get more sophisticated in their illegal copying and sharing efforts, and consumers continue to turn to pirated content for their entertainment fix. “This massive loss of income is more than the gross domestic product of whole geographical regions! Zimbabwe is not spared from this, and our creative sectors are suffering,” Jemsana noted. “Local actors, actresses, producers, directors, sound engineers, cameramen and all the people employed in our creative industries lose out when pirates steal content. Beyond the film and television sector, piracy affects software, music, literature and other fields. This prevents Zimbabwean creatives from being able to tell our own stories and has a devastating knock-on effect on the Zimbabwe economy.” Jemsana said MultiChoice Zimbabwe had been at the forefront of the battle against content piracy hence being a member of Partners Against Piracy, a pan-African campaign established specifically to fight piracy, support content-producing industries and protect creatives from job losses because of piracy. He said joining hands with the arts council was meant to ensure greater impact of anti-piracy efforts in Zimbabwe. “As a leader in local and international video entertainment, MultiChoice Zimbabwe has long addressed the issue of pirated content with Zimbabwean audiences through its television channels and on its digital platforms, raising awareness of this crime and how consumers can avoid falling prey to it,” he said. The anti-piracy workshop takes place on the backdrop of the World Intellectual Property Day commemorated on April 26, and within Culture Month, celebrated annually in May. This year’s edition of Culture Month is being commemorated under the theme Our culture: Building Zimbabwe Brick by Brick reflects the national drive to implement the national development strategy. Jemsana said the workshop would raise awareness on intellectual property and piracy within the arts and culture sector targeting both up-and-coming and mainstream artists and key stakeholders in the cultural and creative industries. The workshop will also highlight the importance of public-private co-operation in the fight against piracy and safeguarding copyright. “Piracy poses a legitimate industry threat, and immediate action must be taken to stop pirates and protect the rights of content creators and providers. This action must come from the united efforts of government institutions, entertainment businesses and all professionals working in the creative industries,” Jemsana noted. “This first workshop being jointly hosted by NACZ and MultiChoice Zimbabwe, is supported by Zimbabwe Music Rights Association and the Zimbabwe International Film Festival Trust. It promises to go a long way in educating the public about the seriousness of this problem and better protecting our artists.” NACZ acting director Barbara Gotore said Zimbabwe was home to a rich and dynamic creative sector with huge potential for growth, but piracy was undermining this potential and actualised growth. “The prevalence of piracy can be attributed to a number of contributory factors, including the scarcity and high cost of genuine products, poverty, poor distribution networks, a slow judicial system, and new digital technologies that easily enable the illegal, mass reproduction of copyright protected works,” she said.

                     Exploring Bling 4's music themes
                    ","RAPPER Bling 4, born Farai Gadzani, has potential to become a big figure in the local hip-hop scene due to his deep lyrics, modest demeanour and impactful music. His music zeroes in on the plight of Zimbabwean youths. Mature themes are explored in the artiste's songs. Bling 4 is basking in glory with his most recent release Ama2k, which explored a number of contentious topics related to those born from 2000. The musician has demonstrated consistency in the music industry, which has seen him performing at prestigious events alongside big names in the industry. In contrast to other artistes who pull public stunts or throw tantrums in anticipation of releasing new music, Bling 4 has not yet been caught up in social media drama or controversy to prop his music. NewsDay Weekender Life & Style examined a few of the topics the musician has addressed in his songs over the years. Confronting Ama2k The artiste took his voice and lyrical prowess to confront the generation. The musician broke his silence by imploring the public to urge youths born from the year 2000 to get their lives in order, saying that he had been watching them for a while. The rapper painted the generation as hopelessly unprepared for the future, fixated on pricey brands of cars, mobile phones and clothes. He portrayed this generation as obsessed with social media, having grown up in the digital age surrounded by smartphones, social media and instant connectivity. He said the generation is only concerned about having the internet to browse what bloggers have posted on social media. The musician further depicted the generation as actively participating in hate speech and cyber bullying on social media. Refusing to give in to peer pressure The artiste’s music relates to the pressure people are put under, especifically by social media. Bling 4 explored the theme of living an authentic life, showing a resolute, hardworking man who is content with his life while persistently striving for improvement, refusing to give in to peer pressure and living under the false pretense of belonging to groups he does not belong to. The song also serves as a reminder to young people that success does not come easily. Making mistakes Along with highlighting mental health issues as people turn to alcohol as an escape from reality, the artiste also explored emotional struggles that resonated with many listeners who have gone through similar struggles. To stay on the right path during these trying times, the artiste prays to God to lead and guide him through song. Predicament of the country’s youths Many young people in the nation can identify with the artiste's exploration of the predicament of a young person without support systems, who cannot afford to miss out on opportunities or make mistakes in life while their counterparts from wealthy families appear to have everything on a silver platter.

                     Model urges men to seek help when vulnerable
                    ","THE World Health Organisation defines mental health as a state of well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realise their abilities, learn and work well and contribute to their community. In Zimbabwe, several initiatives have been carried out in advocating for mental health with artistes coming through with awareness messages. Model Aaron Kahari urged men to seek help when they are vulnerable, be involved in various initiatives as a way of coping with stressful situations and find ways to express themselves fully, adding that they should never be victims of mental health. NewsDay Life & Style caught up with Kahari to talk about developments in the modelling industry, mental challenges faced by men, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, male models breaking barriers and diversity in the industry, among other things. Background I am Aaron Kahari. I was groomed at Top Model Zimbabwe under Karin Coric in 2021. I had the opportunity to work with a lot of brands like Edgars, Jet and Victaks Wear to mention a few. I also took part in a number of fashion shows. I then ventured into pageantry last year participating in the Mr Zimbabwe International which was my first competition where I emerged third runner up. I also worked with popular musicians like Freeman where I featured on his song called Man to Man as a video vixen. I love socialising and working out in the gym. Developments in the industry The modelling industry has become versatile with flexibility on age, weight, height or body types. There are no restrictions anymore although one is required to maintain healthy habits. Male models have broken barriers of fashion and modelling by participating in shows and photoshoots where they are flexible enough to wear feminine clothing and makeup. This has helped in breaking various gender norms and stereotypes surrounding masculinity. It has been difficult for some conservative and traditional people to accept the breaking of barriers by men who venture into modelling while others are embracing the change being brought forth by the fashion world. Such is to be expected as people have different views on life. Diversity Diversity and representation in the modelling industry helps people to feel included because it reflects reality. It allows people to connect with a wider audience, which promotes inclusivity and empowers people with confidence. Contribution of social media Social media advertising being pushed by the fashion world has fostered inclusivity. There has been inclusion of different body types, ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. This has impacted a lot of people positively because there is fair representation of people which restores self-esteem, confidence and body positivity. Ways of coping with mental health problems Men face various mental health challenges including societal pressure to maintain traditional masculine norms, misconceptions that sharing feelings and emotional breakdowns, just to mention a few, are signs of being weak. This gives rise to feelings of isolation, depression and anxiety. My ways of coping with stress include seeking support from friends and going to the gym but there are other ways of coping with stress like seeing a professional, meditation, removing yourself from stressful conditions and people and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I recommend men going through mental health issues to express themselves through writing in a journal, partake in poetry sessions, art or music and also participate in community events. Exploring various coping mechanisms helps to keep a healthy emotional life. It is important for men to recognise the value of seeking help when needed. "

                     Mlalazi acknowledges fans request for Manyowa collabo
                    ","IN response to requests from his fans, multi-award-winning gospel singer Everton Mlalazi has released Fill Our Hearts, a captivating worship song featuring celebrated songstress, Janet Manyowa. The song, which was released on Wednesday, has an accompanying video that was produced by FilminZim in partnership with Reliable Hub of Innovation Media House under the supervision of Mlalazi’s wife-cum-manager Gamuchirai. The song is a showcase of powerful vocals and rich lyrical prowess by Mlalazi and Manyowa while the visuals and cinematography depict great artistry. The video also features actor Farai Chigudu and comedian Dereck Nziyakwi. “Towards the end of March, we made a poll as to which female Zimbabwean gospel artiste fans thought I should collaborate with and Janet was the favourite among many. I approached her, she agreed and the whole of April we worked on the song writing, recording and video filming until the release on May 1,” Mlalazi told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday. “The song was produced by Nigel Nyangombe and for the production of the song’s video, we approached FilminZim which gave us Malaika Mushandu (former Miss Zimbabwe) as the video director and Joe Njagu (veteran filmmaker) as the cinematographer to come up with a video. The production team roped in all the fantastic actors to be part of the cast.” Speaking on the inspiration behind composing the song, Mlalazi, who frontlines the Worship Therapy band, said: “We need the presence of the Lord right now more than ever. We need Him to fill our hearts and minds and change us to better people.” “It is the message of our time when what we need the most is hope and trust in the Lord, that when we open our hearts, He is ready to fill us. Psalms 81:10 says I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.” The Ndokutewera Muponesi hitmaker reckons it has been an amazing experience working with fellow multi-award winner Manyowa. “Janet does not just have musical ability, but depth in her knowledge of the scriptures. Everything was flawless and we were all excited to be working on this song together,” Mlalazi said. A member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, Mlalazi said the key to a fulfilled heart lies in embracing the spiritual teachings of Christianity. “According to scripture, Ephesians 5:18, our ultimate purpose is to find joy in God’s presence and live to His glory, but this can only be achieved through the Holy Spirit,” he noted. “What an honour to have collaborated with my brother Everton Mlalazi for this beautiful track. Our prayer is that He may fill our hearts,” Manyowa said. Commenting on the video on YouTube, @craigtsepontuliki00 said: “Behold the celestial union of two celestial voices, a sacred duet that transports the listener to the ethereal realm where the soul is lulled by the heavenly choruses of Everton Mlalazi and Janet Manyowa. Gaze upon the pristine beauty of this visual ode, a divine dance of sound and sight, captured in a paradise-like setting that mirrors the eternal glory of the Almighty.”  “Fill our Hearts is enveloped in a symphonic masterpiece, their angelic harmonies weave a tapestry of hope and inspiration, resounding with the powerful message that a fulfilled heart is found in the embrace of divine teachings.” The video had garnered 29 000 views on YouTube by yesterday.

Major events to mark this day’s celebrations include a walkathon, which was inspired and founded by Guti to encourage fitness and healthy living as well as a  music concert to be held at ZAOGA Braeside the same day. In a statement, chairperson of the Ezekiel Handinawangu Guti day Elder Tawanda Sarireni said: “People will be walking in groups and the target distances are two-and-half, five and 10 kilometres. People will also do aerobics with a renowned fitness trainer.” The event will be graced by local and international gospel artistes including United Kingdom-based Free to Worship group already in the country for the event. Local artistes set to perform include gospel diva Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave, Sebastian Magacha, Pastor Haisa, Pastor David Mabvuramiti and Sir Benjamin Rupapa. Sarireni noted that Archbishop Guti’s achievements undoubtedly changed people’s lives as evidenced by the establishment of churches in every community in the country and in over 169 nations, schools, hospitals and a university (Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University) in the country and abroad. He said such achievements were worth celebrating as they would inspire generations. Sarireni added that they had partnered private organisations, the business community and government ministries such as the ICT ministry. Officials from the ministry descended on Chitungwiza on Tuesday to train the youth on how to use computers with much emphasis on cyber security.

                     Flying Bantu aims to attain regional appeal
                    ","TINASHE Maoneni, the leader and vocalist of the Afro-fusion band Flying Bantu, has confidence the ensemble will attain its goal of being the most sought-after entertainers. The band has Amkela Moyo (guitar), Bongani Moyo (bass), Joshua Alufasi (keys) and Sam Gulubane (drums). Maoneni describes himself as a dreamer and creative with a deep desire and love for food, art, people, nature and old cars who transfers this understanding of creative work into music and dance. “Flying Bantu is a band from Victoria Falls. Born of the Zambezi and its magical pool of people and cultures. Our music enculturates various genres from rock, reggae, funk, jazz giving an alternative and unique African expression,”Maoneni told NewsDay Life & Style. He said the band’s forthcoming album was purposefully hewed to harness the African region and global appeal and increase the number of followers to their shows. Flying Bantu’s second 10-track album is titled FejaFeja, street lingo for an unconventional form of illicit gambling characterised by conjuring and optical illusion. New approach to the arts which encompasses music, film and performances I am not sure we can call it new more than it is different. The whole idea is to just remain as true to ourselves as possible and not fall too much into the industry norms and dictates. Otherwise we all end up sounding and looking the same. We believe everyone has a unique voice and that there are many different palates out there for different expressions. If we stick to it, explore and carve out our own sound and texture, then maybe someone will relate. Activities lined up in support of music after the Sauti zaBusara Festival After Sauti we already had a tour of South Africa and have a couple of festivals lined up in Zimbabwe and Botswana. But our main thrust this year is to finalise the release of our album FejaFeja.  FejaFeja has tracks like Dzora Moyo, Mwana Wenyu, Chizukuru, FejaFeja, These days, Lala, Watching Angels, Forever Together and No Money No Honey. The album has a broad theme and reflects on the hardships that people endured as a result of the COVID-19-induced difficulties which prompted a new undesirable normalcy of a hand-to-mouth living that has been adopted by many people. The album seeks to restore the spirit of hard work through developing honest transactional ways of doing profitable business. Achievements The biggest one is remaining steadfast and pushing our dream. It is tough out here Tendai. In a country without much of a music industry to speak of; we have toured internationally, we have performed at major festivals and music events alongside esteemed and powerful African musicians. We have put out an album and now are releasing a second one which we are really proud of. Comment on the African music scene I do not know where to start but it holds massive potential. What the Nigerians and South Africans are doing with Afro-beats and amapiano is just the tip of the iceberg. It is paving way and giving confidence to the African musician while opening the eyes and ears of the world to the immense talent we have here. We just need to believe more in ourselves and our right to be seen and heard. African music is a force to reckon with and can lead from the front. Closing remarks   Thank you to everyone who has supported our dream. Without an ear to land on there can be no music. Please be on the lookout for our upcoming album this year so when you get a chance; hop on to our social media platforms and stay connected. "

""We are going to be doing more of these shows including, not only that but also workshops to try and foster knowledge about what jazz is because there's a lot of misconception about the genre. “People think that when you play smooth, slow music or when a song is just slow it is jazz (but) there is a whole concept to jazz, so we also need to start educating the young ones and the public about what it is."" Meanwhile, Dereck Mpofu made a surprise appearance before Willis Wataffi Afirika who was invited on stage by Prudence towards the end of the show. Wataffi took the crowd down memory lane with Afrika Revenge's yesteryear hit song ""Wanga"". Also in attendance was Jazz patron and renowned eye specialist Solomon Guramatunhu –who was the guest of honour, Katrin Simon (German embassy head of culture) and prominent lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa. ""It was an amazing experience and a super honour to be up on stage with artists whom I idolised before I began my musical journey as well as fellow artists I am now proud to call my friends. I felt special and encouraged amid my elders. We all amazingly complemented each other so well and I feel it's the beginning of a swell jazz musical journey,"" Nicholar said. Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Katomeni said having a platform to perform is always welcome and appreciated by a lot of local jazz artists. ""Having such a unique event being put together was special…I truly enjoyed the whole event, it was absolutely memorable and of course, I cannot leave out the audience that came through to listen to some fantastic jazz music and celebrate in one accord the beauty of jazz music,"" said Katomeni. International Jazz Day is recognised in over 190 countries worldwide. In Harare the crowd's enthusiasm was palpable, and the artists fed off the energy, pushing the boundaries of their creativity. Rute Mbangwa performed Shiri an original composition as well as the song ‘Autumn Leaves’ which is a jazz standard track. ""The jazz show was an unforgettable experience,"" said Mbangwa after her display in which she perfomed Shiri, an original composition as well as the song ‘Autumn Leaves’ –a jazz standard track. ""Collaborating with fellow musicians allowed us to create a mesmerising fusion of sounds that left the audience enthralled. It was a true celebration of the power of jazz in bringing people together to create something beautiful in the moment. The concert not only showcased unity of purpose among the artists but also Meck's organisational capacity in putting together a seamless experience for jazz lovers and highlighting the genre's vibrant community. Established by the General Conference of UNESCO in 2011 and recognised by the United Nations General Assembly, International Jazz Day brings together countries and communities worldwide.

                    ","AWARD-WINNING actress, playwright and UN women goodwill ambassador Danai Gurira says she wants to shine a light on Africans to fight impunity and amplify voices of those who are never seen or heard. Gurira made the remarks recently during the United Nations Security Council Open Debate on preventing conflict-related sexual violence where she urged the council and member States to acknowledge women and survivors all over the world. “Shockingly, sexual violence in conflict zones against women and children is being committed all over the world. This issue has become vast and widespread, from Colombia to Ukraine, Israel, occupied Palestinian territories, Haiti and closer to home for me as a Zimbabwean, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Central Republic of Africa and Sudan, this issue has become prevalent for more countries, not fewer,” she said. Gurira urged the UN Security Council and member States to acknowledge women, survivors and to specifically shine a light on people of Africa in particular, to fight impunity. “Nothing is more dangerous than crimes that are not acknowledged, unseen and allowed to persist. My hope is to amplify voices of those who are never seen or heard, to acknowledge their suffering, make sure they are not forgotten and to hold those who allow this to continue responsible.” Gurira said. The actress said she was exposed to issues of sexual violence when she, as a playwright, sought to create a narrative that would amplify the voices of women and girls caught in the crosshairs of war, where she was seeking their unheard voices and it became her broadway play Eclipsed. With the help of a friend at the United Nations who at the time worked in the Children and Armed Conflict department, she visited Liberia and spent time with women who had experienced atrocity wishing to be heard and participate in the change process and to heal from all that had been taken from them. Gurira is best known for starring in films such as the Black Panther as General Okoye, her role in the series The Walking Dead, Continuum, Eclipsed and Familiar, among others. She is also the founder of Love Our Girls, an awareness-building campaign focusing on the plight of women and girls around the globe and the co-founder of Almasi Arts, which gives access and opportunity to the African drama artists.

                     Nyanga: A tale of courage, conservation amid adversity
                    ","VETERAN filmmaker Eddie Ndhlovu has described his forthcoming film titled Nyanga as a tale of courage and conservation amid adversity. Shot at Lake Kyle in Nyanga and in Harare over a span of 15 days, the film showcases the stunning beauty of Zimbabwe’s natural landscapes while highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. Set against the breathtaking backdrop of Nyanga National Park, the film, directed by the dynamic duo of Ndhlovu and Jakov Dakovic, promises to captivate audiences with its powerful narrative and stunning cinematography. Produced by Talent Chitauro and written by Ndhlovu, Nyanga is a work of love that celebrates the rich cultural heritage and natural beauty of Zimbabwe. The film follows the journey of Panganayi, a dedicated ranger whose life is intertwined with the majestic rhinos he tirelessly protects. Portrayed by the talented Collin Ncube, Panganayi’s unwavering commitment to conservation is put to the test when he faces the ruthless threat of poachers infiltrating the park. When news of the poachers’ arrival reaches him, Panganayi confronts his greatest challenge yet. Armed with nothing, but determination and the support of his dedicated team, he embarks on a perilous mission to protect the rhinos at all costs. The film delves deep into Panganayi’s personal struggles, from the loss of his beloved wife to the challenges of raising their children amid the turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through it all, Panganayi finds solace in his family and draws strength from their unwavering support. Ndhlovu said Nyanga was more than just a film, but a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the power of resilience in the face of adversity. He said the choice of Nyanga National Park as the backdrop for the film had several motivations and storytelling advantages. “The first impression we got from Nyanga when we did our location scouting was the natural beauty of Nyanga National Park. Its stunning landscapes and scenery provided a visually appealing and immersive environment for the audience. The natural beauty enhanced the storytelling by creating a sense of wonder, emphasising the importance of conservation and also bringing out the aspect of the setting of the film which is a remote park,” Ndhlovu said. “Nyanga National Park has a cultural heritage and historical significance that was woven into the storytelling. It also has historical landmarks that brought to life the cinematic picture that we were looking for. He added: “Also, we wanted to film in a real national park as the setting brought an air of authenticity to the film. It allowed us to capture the unique characteristics and atmosphere of Nyanga National Park, making the audience feel like they are truly involved in the story.” Despite facing numerous challenges during production, including unpredictable weather conditions and logistical complexities, Ndhlovu said the dedicated team behind the production of the film remained steadfast in its commitment to bringing the important story to life. “With meticulous planning and unwavering determination, we overcame every obstacle to deliver a cinematic masterpiece that is sure to leave a lasting impact on audiences,” Ndhlovu said. “As the film prepares for its much-anticipated release, audiences can look forward to being transported on a soul-stirring journey that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the importance preserving our planet’s precious wildlife.” The cast of the film that uses Shona with English subtitles includes Andre Ndhlovu and Brandon Mushaninga as the DOPS starring Collin Ncube, Benhildah Kandawasvika, Hardlife Makuku, Llyod Mazengula, Talent Nyamayedenga and Peter Chester.

Ntandoyami Tanatsiwa Chikore digital and communications officer at Kumbekumbe Trust said the Street Café was a platform which intended to uplift the youth through performance and visual arts disciplines like dance, music, theatre, drawing and painting. Chikore said Kumbekumbe Street Café would be a regular activity that would bring the youth together through the arts to share their common values about education and career while they have fun. “This Street Café has helped us to bring together people through a creative process which involves usage of the arts,” Chikore said.

Masa ran from April 16 to 18 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Anibal told NewsDay Life & Style that she highly rates Masa which became her second international tour this year after a well-received performance at the Sauti zaBusara in February.  The Masa is a cultural platform for promoting African performing arts. And some of their objectives are to support creativity and good quality productions including facilitating the movement of artistes and their works within Africa and throughout the world. Anibal will pre-launch her music album Maria Wenyu on May 3 at the Ella the Garden in Harare. The event will include a Press conference and time to share her memories with fans after her performance at the Masa. “My Maria Wenyu pre album launch shall give the audience quality time through songs Maria Wenyu, Gogoride, Bhonzo Muderere and Sarungano ahead of the official album and music video launch on June 8 at a venue yet to be decided. My forthcoming music album is a collective effort of many music producers such as Keith Farquharson, Trust Semende, Chiweda and Rodney, among others. “I had two performances, the first one was at the Pelais De La Culture — Salle Francois Lougah and on April 18 which was our Independence Day in Zimbabwe I performed at Yelams where I met Dobet Gnahore (Côte d'Ivoire), Nelida Kaar (Cameroon), Zulu Alves (Cape Verde), Maasai Vocals (Kenya) and Freddy Masamba (DRC). My greatest experience was with Dobet Gnahore who had her fond memories of watching the late Chioniso Maraire rekindled through my mbira playing. Mbira legend Chioniso Maraire was arguably one of the youthful mbira players to emerge from Zimbabwe who became internationally celebrated and left a void which is yet to be filled. “African culture is very diverse and African music has so many beautiful characteristics which are interlinked and therefore becoming easier and easier for us to connect to each other in a jam session,” Anibal said.

Anibal believes that everyday is a learning day and wishes to claim global appeal in teaching and training after her studies at the Midlands State University. The Bhonzo Muderere hitmaker shared the beauty of her voice with Jah Prayzah and hopes she remains inspirational to many school-going children who are doing visual and performance  arts as a subject where music holds a huge stake. “The new curriculum has visual and performance arts as a subject and shall help in levelling the ground and ascertaining the relevance of infrastructural development. The cost of establishing musical arts education centres is high and requires a collective approach which involves the government and the corporate world. “Competitions such as the Allied Arts, Chibuku Neshamwari, Jikinya Dance Festivals have helped in putting into prominence music and dance cultures of Zimbabwe and ironically there is still an annoying level of lack of supporting infrastructure including well manufactured music instruments,” she said.

                     Brian Nhanhanga headlines Manicaland Jazz Fest
                    ","AWARD-WINNING jazz guitarist and singer Brian Nhanhanga is set to grab attention at the inaugural Manicaland Jazz Festival scheduled for April 30 at the Micasa Pub where several established and up-and-coming artistes will take part. Nhanhanga, famed for the award-winning jazz instrumental Matida Hostel and now a teacher at the Zimbabwe Music Crossroads Academy, will be out to offer more than a performance at the event. Carol Makoni, provincial arts administrator National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ), Manicaland, said the festival would coincide with the International Jazz Day which is a United Nations observance celebrated annually on April 30. The day is meant to create awareness on the importance of jazz music. The festival is the brainchild of NACZ. “The Manicaland Jazz Festival intends to breathe life into the jazz genre which is not very prominent in Manicaland. The bands set to perform include WaCharie,  Steve Chikotie, Expression Band, Brian Nhanhanga and Too Open Band. Renowned drummer, Sam Mataure, will also perform at the festival,” Makoni said. “Academic and music education guru Tendekayi Kuture, who is a retired music lecturer from Africa University, will present a paper on the history of jazz music and its evolution to the different forms which are being played nowadays.” Jazz music was well received by music educators for classroom teaching as the musicians behind it quickly adopted an emphasis to usage of exciting elements of music including proficiency in performance and improvisations. In a similar manner it appears it is the only type of music after classical and choral music to occupy a significant part of school curriculum. Accordingly, several schools in response to Industry 5.0 and Continuous Assessment Learning Activities now have jazz bands. Prince Edward, Allan Wilson, Churchill Boys and Watershed College bands pursue both popular music and jazz narratives.  Zimbabwe College of Music in conjunction with Africa University run a Bachelor’s Degree in Jazz which has several alumni who have impacted the arts industry significantly. The International Jazz Day is an international day declared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in 2011 to promote jazz music as a soft tool for uniting civilisations across the globe and it is celebrated annually on April 30. Over the years the American embassy in Zimbabwe through its Public Affairs Section has brought in several jazz artistes and bands to entertain at the Harare international Festival of Arts. Through such a development it is quite notable that each and every continent or country just to be on point now has its own type of jazz music. Tanga weKwaSando is a well-known township jazz musician whereas the likes of Dudu Manhenga, Prudence Katomeni, Philbert Marova, Victor Kunonga, Brian Nhanhanga are popular for what is called Afro-jazz.

https://www.chronicle.co.zw/arne-slot-set-to-make-big-decisions-on-20-liverpool-players-amid-mixed-fortunes/,Arne Slot set to make big decisions on 20 Liverpool players amid mixed fortunes,"Arne Slot is set to become Liverpool manager this summer and will have a big decision to make on the club’s loan players Liverpool’s 20 loaned-out players have had a mixed bag of experiences in the 2023-24 season, with new manager Arne Slot set to take over from Jurgen Klopp and reshape the squad. Slot, who is currently managing Feyenoord, has a reputation for nurturing young talent, making him an ideal successor to Klopp, who has successfully integrated several academy players into his team. This season, a significant number of Liverpool’s emerging stars have been sent out on loan – 20 in total. Not all are ready for first-team action just yet, but many will be hoping to impress Slot when he takes the reins at Anfield. Here’s how each of Liverpool’s 20 loanees have performed this season, according to Mirror Football. Calvin Ramsay Ramsay joined Liverpool amid high expectations in the summer of 2022, but his two loan spells this season at Preston North End and Bolton Wanderers have been disappointing. The Scottish player has struggled to make his mark at either club, suggesting that another loan spell may be necessary before he’s ready for Liverpool’s first team. Rhys Williams Williams’ season has been far from successful, with the defender seeing more action for Liverpool’s Under-23s than during his loan spell at Aberdeen. In fact, the 23 year old rarely made it onto the bench for the Dons, indicating that he’s some distance away from securing a place in Liverpool’s first team. Fabio Carvalho Carvalho kicked off the season at RB Leipzig, but was primarily used as a super sub by the Bundesliga squad. After his relationship with Leipzig soured, he was shipped out to Hull, where he shone in their play-off push. Despite falling just short, the Portuguese international stands a good chance of being promoted to Liverpool’s first team in the new season. Harvey Davies Davies spent a large part of the season as Crewe’s go-to keeper, but has been dropped from their squad entirely during the final stretch. Although Caominhin Kelleher is expected to be sold this summer, Davies needs another season on loan before he can be considered as a potential back-up for Alisson. Owen Beck Beck, who has been a standout performer for Dundee, is one of Liverpool’s most impressive loanees. Before an injury sidelined him in March, Beck had been a regular starter for the Scottish side, scoring twice and providing four assists in 28 appearances, helping them secure a top-half finish. With doubts over Kostas Tsimikas’ quality, Beck is a prime candidate for a first-team call-up. Sepp van den Berg Van den Berg has been one of the few bright spots in a dismal season for Mainz. The 05ers have been fighting relegation all season, with Van den Berg sitting out just one match. With Liverpool’s defence set for a revamp this summer, he could be asked to step up. Anderson Arroyo It seems unlikely that Arroyo will ever become a regular for Liverpool. The 24 year old has been a starter for Spanish second-tier side Burgos this season, but with Conor Bradley emerging as Trent Alexander-Arnold’s top back-up at right-back, a sale this summer seems probable. James Balagizi This season has been a let down for Balagizi, with the 20 year old struggling to make his mark on loan at either Wigan or Kilmarnock. The midfielder has only made 13 appearances in total this term and another loan move this summer seems to be his best bet. Dominic Corness Corness has had a successful campaign at Yvderon-Sport in the Swiss Super League, helping them likely avoid relegation. The midfielder has made 21 appearances in all competitions, though another loan move would probably be best for the 21 year old. Adam Lewis Lewis has had a mixed season on loan at Newport County, having several spells out of a team which endured a disappointing year in League Two. This was his second spell at Rodney Parade and a permanent move to an EFL team appears to be his most likely move this summer. Jakub Ojrzynski Another young Red who has had mixed fortunes out on loan is Ojrzynski, with the Polish keeper spending much of the season as back-up at Dutch second-tier side Den Bosch. He will need regular game-time on loan next season if he is to convince his parent club that he has a future at Anfield. Billy Koumetio Koumetio will be eager to put this season behind him as swiftly as possible. Initially, he was loaned out to Dunkerque, but a disagreement led to his return to Anfield. The defender was then dispatched to Blackburn Rovers, but he didn’t manage to make an appearance for the Championship team. It’s unlikely that Slot will call him up this summer. Luke Hewitson The 19 year old has had a successful season with Stalybridge Celtic. The non-league side were so impressed that they extended his loan in January, and another move seems likely for Hewitson this summer. James Norris Despite a challenging start to the season, Norris finished the campaign as Tranmere’s starting left-back. With Rovers finishing mid-table in League Two, another loan move would be best for the 21 year old’s development. Tyler Morton Morton has been the star of Hull’s bid for a play-off place in the Championship and seems to be the most likely to receive a call from Slot. He scored three goals and provided five assists in 41 appearances for the Tigers, as well as shining on the international stage for England’s Under-21s. Slot is likely looking forward to working with the young talent. Nat Phillips After a tough stint at Celtic, Phillips has found success at Preston. He has made 18 appearances for North End and has proven to be a reliable senior option. However, with his contract expiring in 12 months and the Englishman keen to get more game time, it might be the right time to sell. Luca Stephenson Stephenson proved to be a valuable asset for Barrow this season, despite not contributing any goals or assists. His team narrowly missed out on the play-offs in the third tier and another loan move would likely be the best option for him to secure a regular position. – liverpoolecho.co.uk      "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/antipas-sings-donovan-praises/,Antipas sings Donovan praises,"Innocent Kurira, [email protected] CHICKEN Inn coach Joey Antipas says goalkeeper Donovan Bernard will be missed if he makes a move away from the club. This comes after his heroic exploits that saw him save Chicken Inn from what looked to be a defeat against Bulawayo Chiefs at the weekend. The match ended nil-all thanks to Bernard. Bernard saved a Never Rauzhi penalty kick before going on to make other point blank saves which proved why he is the country’s number one. Antipas had nothing but nice words for his shotstopper. “Donovan is a great keeper. To have him in our side is great news. He is keeping clean sheets and for us it’s a great boost. If he has to go we will miss him. We will certainly miss Donovan if he does go,” said Antipas. Already, South Africa’s Supersport United chief scout, Paul Matthews has been in the country to assess Bernard. Matthews was in the company of one of the country’s renowned player agents, Gibson Mahachi when Chicken Inn played host to Dynamos. The goalkeeper is set to go through further assessment when Zimbabwe play their World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa next month. The Warriors’ fixtures against Lesotho and South Africa will be played across the Limpopo River, since Zimbabwe is still without a stadium certified to play host to international matches. Rufaro Stadium is still being renovated and even struggled to get the Zifa First Instance Board (FIB)’s approval for the hosting of Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches Interestingly, earlier on this year, Supersport United, who are fondly known as Matsatsantsa aPitori, invited Dynamos goalminder Martin Mapisa for a brief trial stint. Supersport United provides home to ex-Warriors duo of Washington Arubi and Onismor Bhasera. The club once had Kudakwashe Mahachi, the late imposing Warriors goalkeeper George Chigova and Terrence Dzukamanja in their books.—@innocentskizoe "

Named after the late Vice President, Landa J. Nkomo, the schools officials and learners expressed excitement to receive the generous donation, which goes a long way in capacitating the institution’s sporting performance. The expressed gratitude to Mr Nkomo for assisting them saying sport was a serious component of the new curriculum. The colorful sports kits, were presented to the excited students during a special ceremony at the school grounds where Mr Nkomo spoke passionately about his father’s love for education and sports, emphasizing the importance of both in shaping young minds and building a strong community.  Mr Nkomo, who is based in America, following in his father’s footsteps of generosity and kindness said the gesture meant so much to his family. “We came together as family and friends to ensure that our father’s legacy continues. I have a strong sports history and that is why I chose to donate sports equipment,” he said. “We also want to ensure that the school introduces other sporting activities that are not offered at the school such as basketball and cricket. This is also to ensure the children are occupied and do not get involved in delinquent behaviour,” said Mr Nkomo.  He said the act of kindness has a ripple effect, and hoped that it will inspire others to give back and make a positive impact in their own communities. “The spirit of giving and community unity is alive and well. The legacy of our father will live on and hope to see it inspire generations to come,” said Mr Nkomo. The learners cheered and clapped as they tried on their new uniforms, feeling a sense of pride and unity in representing their school on the sports field. Mr Nkomo said the impact of his donation will be felt for years to come, inspiring the next generation to strive for excellence both academically and athletically. “As the children embark on their sporting journey I want them to feel a strong connection to a man who dedicated his life to serving his community and building a brighter future for all,” said Mr Nkomo.

https://www.chronicle.co.zw/watch-quick-flashes-dazzle-bosso/,WATCH: Quick flashes dazzle Bosso,"Nkosilathi Sibanda at Barbourfields Stadium  Highlanders 0-2 FC Platinum THE glory that laced Highlanders’ good start to the Castle Lager Premiership was dented as they succumbed to a two-nil loss against visiting FC Platinum at Barbourfields yesterday. Early goals by FC Platinum, that came in a quick flash inside 10 minutes was all that separated the two teams. FC Platinum opened the nets in two minutes of play through Juan Mutudza, who well positioned himself to finish off a co-ordinated play. Highlanders rear guard was caught off guard and exposed their goalkeeper Raphael Pitisi, who dived the wrong way and let in a beauty of a shot. Inside the five minutes, Highlanders tried to raid upfront, making fast paces but the visitors’ defence was alert, marking close man-to-man, shutting out the efforts.  FC Platinum had the first corner, just in 10 minutes of play, Mutudza curled it and Lawrence Mhlanga rose high and nodded the second goal. It was two-nil.  Highlanders were not in their usual form. That trusted defensive line led by captain Peter Muduhwa was porous. The goalie was out of sorts in as much as he needed that rear cover. After the second goal, Bosso attempted to regain composure and there was Mvelo Khoza with a thunderbolt that however, went wide. Godfrey Makaruse, who was drafted in to replace Archford Faira, was tackled on his attack in the left lank by Hagiazo Magaya. It was a foul. Mbeba took the kick and skied it.  Bosso’s first corner came in the 30th minute. Prince Ndlovu took the task and got no takers at goal. Another corner kick came and Andrew Mbeba was trusted to pass it through, instead, the ball was blocked by Platinum’ Rainsome Pavari. In that first stanza, Bosso’s midfield failed to create and maintain play. FC Platinum read the match so well and saw that Bosso had a huge lapse in the middle of the park, so much that they made a good advantage of blocking Highlanders’ best offensive moves, in the crosses, coming off the flanks.  The absence of the ever creative Melikhaya Ncube was felt. Ncube was serving a yellow card suspension. At the 37th minute, Bosso had the chance to reply as McKinnon Mushore’s shot hit the upright post with the rebound landing on Prince Ndlovu’s boots, who let it wide and made the fans sigh in disbelief of a moment they saw as a redemption. However, it wasn’t to be. FC Platinum had their second and third corners at 39 minutes taken by Panashe Mutimbanyoka. They yielded nothing. A forth corner cane their way in the 43rd minute. The whistle was blown to end the first-half. All was well for the Norman Mapeza-coached side. In the opening 15 minutes of the second-, Highlanders will rue the chances they missed, they could have got the consolation and even levelled matters. Lynoth Chikuhwa had a near miss as he hit the ball to the far post. It was another opportunity for recovery. Showing off their Pure Platinum Play, the visitors could have netted their third goal through Hagiazo Magaya. Both teams made changes in bringing in substitutes. FC Platinum were the first as they made a double substitution in 61 minutes when Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya came for Wilfred Muvirimi and Oscar Bhebhe for Davison Murowa. Bosso, reeling under pressure, in the 66th minute brought Marvellous Chigumira, resting Mvelo Khoza. Calvin Chigonero came in for Devine Mhindirira. The losing side also brought in Talent Dube to replace Godfrey Makaruse in the 79th minute. At the stroke of full time, in the 83rd minute, Mapeza made another change. Brighton Manhire replaced Shephard Mhlanga. Kelvin Mangiza was off for Mutudza.  For FC Platinum, the fresh legs could have been to cement the lead they enjoyed so well while for Highlanders coach Kelvin Kaindu it was a desperate search for goals that were elusive. It felt bad for Kaindu and he was in pain for not having Melikhaya on the fold. He admitted his side wasn’t on point yesterday. It was Highlanders’ second loss in the campaign. Kaindu made a reference to Melikhaya Ncube’s absence which he said affected the team. “We were unsettled in the first 10 minutes that we conceded two goals and it is always difficult to come back, especially against a team like FC Platinum. I think Melikhaya’s absence probably affected us. “We didn’t convert chances that came our way. Our opponents scored the chances they got. What happened was failure to convert the numerous chances that we had. Even in the second-half we looked a  stronger side but unfortunately we couldn’t get the goals from the chances we created.  FC Platinum coach, Norman Mapeza was a happy man and heaped praises on his charges. He, however, said he didn’t expect the victory given Bosso’s legacy at Barbourfields and their record so far. – @NkosieLegend.      "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/drama-as-schoolboys-hold-dynamos/,Drama as Schoolboys hold Dynamos,"Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau Dynamos 1-1 Herentals MATCH officials hogged the limelight as low-key Castle Lager Premiership Harare derby between Dynamos and Herentals ended in a controversial draw at Rufaro yesterday. Far side assistant referee Kudzanai Hiya, who flagged Herentals’ Dreamer Liyeto opener for offside with 27 minutes on the clock, again raised his flag when Donald Dzvinyai appeared to have secured the points for Dynamos. With DeMbare players sprinting to celebrate and later confront Hiya, Herentals quickly started play and as they were going clear of goal, the Dynamos bench, led by goalkeepers’ coach Britto Gwere rushed into the pitch to curtail the attack. Apart from the controversy of disallowed goals, the “dirty” match was characterised by crude tackles and every aspect of tension.  After missing an array of chances in the opening half hour, Nomore Chinyerere broke the ice with a fortuitous finish, benefiting largely from poor goalkeeping by Takudzwa Chikosi, who fumbled the tame effort letting it slide in between his legs with 31 minutes played. With the Glamour Boys tiding things up to the break, they had no answers to the Students raids with substitute Milton Chimedza coming to the end of Tino Benza’s cross after 66 minutes. Dynamos gaffer Genesis Mangombe decried his team’s failure to utilise their opportunities. “We should try and make sure that we score goals whenever we get chances. I think we got so many chances in the first-half but we failed to score,” said Mangombe. “Some of these decisions are costing us at the end of the day but I am not a referee. “If it’s a goal, it’s a goal. Even in their (Herentals) goal, I thought there was an infringement on Jalai (Emmanuel). We scored a clear goal but it was disallowed.” His Herentals counterpart Paul Benza said he was not qualified to comment about match officiating although Liyeto’s first-half goal appeared to be legitimate. “I don’t qualify to comment about match officials,” said Benza.    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/boxing-and-wrestling-control-act-falls-short/,Boxing and Wrestling Control Act falls short,"Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Writer THE present Zimbabwe Boxing and Wrestling Control Act (Chapter 25:02) is reportedly outdated and is not aligned with the Constitution of Zimbabwe Amendment (No. 20) Act. 2013, amid revelations that it does not provide for participation for all including women and people with disabilities among other challenges.  The revelations were made by Zimbabwe National Boxing and Wrestling Control Board (ZNBWCB) acting chief executive officer Priscilla Kadungure, a key figure in the day-to-day running of professional boxing in the country. ZNBWCB was established through the Zimbabwe Boxing and Wrestling Control Act Chapter 25:02 of 1956. The objects of the Board are to regulate, control and exercise general supervision over boxing or wrestling at tournaments in Zimbabwe with a view to the elimination of undesirable practices and the protection of the interests of boxers, wrestlers, promoters, officials and the public generally. According to the Boxing and Wrestling Control legislature, which was enacted in 1963, female boxers are not recognised and it had to take the efforts of the board back in the late 1980s to convince the Sports Ministry to allow women to participate in professional boxing. Kudungure said the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act now fails to provide for: “effective professional combat sport dispute resolution mechanisms, participation for all including women and people with disabilities, marketing mechanisms for combat sport and integrated system for smooth transition from amateur to professional combat sports.”  As if that is not enough, Kadungure revealed that the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act (Chapter25: 02) has been found wanting as it also fails to provide for the recognition and reward of outstanding combat sport persons, managers, promoters, trainers, organisations and associations through a national awards system, protection from exploitation, protection of all combat sport persons, managers, trainers, promoters and officials, establishment and maintenance of cordial relations with regional, continental and international combat sport bodies. Zimbabwe Boxing Federation (ZBF) technical director Stephen Masiyambumbi said there was a need to revise the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act to recognise professional women boxers. “Changing the Act will be a move in the right direction. There is a need to change that Act so that it also covers female professional boxers. At a time the Act is silent on professional female boxers, female boxers that include Monalisa Sibanda and Kudakwashe Chivandire have done well in professional circles.  “However, on the amateur side we do not have any problems because our constitution allows us to use International Boxing Association (IBA) rules where we are affiliated. We are governed by the Sports and Recreation (SRC),” said Masiyambumbi. Matabeleland South provincial boxing co-ordinator Maculwamahle Nkomo bemoaned the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act’s failure to provide for participation for all including women and people with disabilities. She said there was a need to include everyone in sport for the benefit of the country as a whole. “It’s a disheartening development. The growth of professional boxing and wrestling into a thriving industry in Zimbabwe can become a reality and as a province we have always believed they can create employment in both disciplines. Our key thrust has been to push for everyone’s inclusion, that is women and those with disabilities. “Everyone should participate in boxing and wrestling as an athlete, official, coach and in any other way. It all calls for total inclusion, it is combat sport no one should be left behind. We are not gifted in the same thing and as a province we are making strides in trying to train deaf people who are interested in boxing,” said Nkomo. – @FungaiMuderere    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/hollick-wins-fbc-zim-open-championship/,Hollick wins FBC Zim Open championship,"Eddie Chikamhi, Harare Bureau GOLFER Michael Hollick kicked off his birthday week in a magical style after he beat a strong field to lift the 2024 FBC Zimbabwe Open Golf championship for the first time at Royal Harare yesterday. Hollick, who turns 37 this Wednesday, needed to summon all his golf prowess to finish with a 20-under-par 268 after an epic final day against South African compatriot Darren Fichardt, who pushed him to the limit with his 18-under-par 270. Zimbabwe’s top professional Scott Vincent was in third place with a respectable 14-under after a feisty last two days on the greens. His brother Kieran Vincent also put up a commendable show, tied for fourth place with Swedish golfer Frederick From. Another Zimbabwean Ben Follett-Smith was sixth on 11-under while highly rated Zimbabwean golf prodigy Matthew Bramford, was the top amateur after finishing on 38th place with a course par score 288. But as has become the norm, it was the South African golfers who dominated the event. Hollick, who won his second Sunshine Tour title with the FBC Zimbabwe Open success, was excited to be on the winning podium, six years after he last participated in the Harare event.  “It’s always amazing to be here. I haven’t been here since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic so coming back was nice and the golf course hasn’t changed in the last five years. It’s always brilliant from the first time I played here in 2011. So I am very pleased,” he said. The 36-year-old had to hold off competition from compatriot Fichardt with six birdies for his final round 66. Hollick had a one-stroke lead going into the final round after he had followed up his first two rounds of 66 and 67 with an impressive 68 in the third round on Saturday, leaving him on 15-under-par. He had a bogey on the 11th hole but the script still went his way yesterday with a crucial birdie in the 17th as Fichardt was dented by two bogeys on the second and 11th holes despite also carding six birdies on the final day.  “It was great,” said Hollick.  “I have been lucky enough to play a lot of tournament golf with Darren over the years and he is one hell of a player. So I knew he wasn’t going to give it to me today and I had to go out and win it. Fortunately, I had the goods and I produced it in the end. “And, the biggest thanks go to the fans here; to the crowd that was out here thank you so much. You really make the most incredible environment for us to play.  “I also want to thank Royal Harare Golf Club for hosting us. The golf course was absolutely amazing and I can’t thank you guys enough.  “I also want to thanks Darren Fichardt, it was a hell of a battle today. We had a good go out there and well-played,” said Hollick.   For the umpteenth time, the Zimbabwe Open Golf title evaded the locals who were left waiting for their breakthrough 24 years since Mark McNulty became the last Zimbabwean to win it in 2000. Scott Vincent reignited Zimbabwe’s hopes for the better part of yesterday but his five-under 67 was not enough to give the top two South Africans a jolt as he settled in third place.  His brother Kieran Vincent had started the day as the best placed Zimbabwean on 11-under par but he failed to continue with the momentum from the previous day. Bogies in the eighth, 10th and 13th holes came at a huge cost for the younger Vincent.  Scott Vincent said the course was tough and will try again next year to challenge for the Zimbabwe Open. “The Sunshine Tour is always strong,” he said.  “They always play really tough and obviously it’s good to have them come here and play and it was fun to play JC Ritchie. He is a fantastic player, he played on the world stage.  “So all in all it’s a strong field and it’s good to be here. I would love to come back and play every year. We have just to see the scheduling and how it all works out,” said Scott Vincent.  Sunshine Tour Tournament Director Gary Todd was thrilled by the successful hosting of the R2,5 million FBC Holdings-sponsored event.  “On behalf of the Sunshine Tour I can’t thank FBC Holdings enough, it was such a fantastic event. It would be rude of me not to mention the Royal Harare Golf Club course staff who have preserved the facility this week in the most outstanding condition.  “To the people of Harare, who have come out and supported us during this magical week, I can’t believe it has gone so quickly and we won’t see you for another year, it’s too long,” said Todd.      "

Goals from Gift Mwinga and Cleopus Dube either half of the break condemned the WiFi boys to their fourth defeat since the start of the campaign. The loss means Telone’s winless streak at home stretches to four matches having last won at home against Manica Diamonds in the second week. WiFi boys coach Tendai Chikuni admitted his side was not good enough. “If you look at it when you play with young guys you have to be at your best, I lost two players. If you look at the backline we lacked cohesion,” he said. “Football is about winning, we are creating and not scoring goals, we will see what happens in the window. Some of the players are not good enough.”  His counterpart Day Gutu was relieved at winning the game after a seemingly difficult period . “It was a sink or survive match for us seeing that we were sitting in a precarious position, so I am relieved that this match has given us the confidence,” Gutu said. Chegutu got the match off to a flying start, taking the lead courtesy of a Mwinga goal after five minutes. The visitors won a free kick on the edge of the box and Mwinga curled the ball in albeit with assistance from TelOne goalkeeper Matripples Muleya who misjudged the flight of the ball. TelOne had the lion’s share of possession but failed to open the Chegutu defence. After a barrage of attacks from the home side, Chegutu doubled their lead with Dube’s glancing header in the 68th minute. The second goal appeared to have given the visitors confidence as they started passing the ball around to frustrate their opponents.   "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/chevrons-save-face/,Chevrons save face,"Brandon Moyo, [email protected]  BRIAN Bennett once again proved why he has been touted as the future of Zimbabwean cricket after a brilliant all round performance which helped the Chevrons secure a consolation eight wickets win in the last T20I against Bangladesh at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh yesterday.  The 20-year-old Bennett took two wickets with the ball (both in the power play) as the Chevrons restricted the Tigers to 157/6 in 20 overs before he went on to score his maiden half-century to help Zimbabwe finish on 158/2 in 18,3 overs.  The Chevrons skipper, Sikandar Raza also came to the party with the bat, scoring an unbeaten half-century in the chase after four low scores.  The youngster was named player of the match.  After salvaging some pride and avoiding a whitewash in yesterday’s encounter, Zimbabwe lost the five-match series 4-1. Speaking after the match, Raza said with the close margin defeats they suffered in the third and fourth games, he felt that the win would finally come and is glad they managed to get it right in the final game and return home with something in the bag.   He added that scoring runs took the monkey off his back.  “It’s nice to go home with a win. Like we said in the last three games we were working our way closer and closer to the victory margin. It’s nice to contribute. In the last presentation I came here and said the only jigsaw puzzle that’s missing is me scoring runs.  “If I can contribute towards the succession of the team it will give me immense pleasure and today is one of those days. It’s always nice to contribute towards the winning of the side. I am very proud of the squad and I’m sure these young guns will take Zimbabwe forward,” said Raza.  Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bowl first.  Bennett and fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani were the most successful Chevrons bowlers, picking two wickets apiece.  Bennett finished with figures of 2/20 while the lanky Muzarabani had figures of 2/22 in their four overs. Bennett had Soumya Sarkar and Towhid Hridoy caught for seven and one run respectively.  Muzarabani had Tanzid Hasan and Mahmudullah caught as well for two and 54 runs respectively. The other two wickets that fell were taken by Zimbabwe’s all time leading wicket taker in T20Is, Luke Jongwe and Wellington Masakadza.  Mahmudullah’s 54 runs came off 44 deliveries and was the Tigers’ top run getter while Jaker Ali finished unbeaten on 24 runs off 11 balls.  In their chase, Zimbabwe’s opener Tadiwanashe Marumani fell early for one run off seven balls before solid partnership between Bennett and Raza took the team across the line.  Bennett would go on to fall for his career high of 70 runs off 49 deliveries while Raza played a crucial captain’s knock of 72 runs not out from 46 balls. Jonathan Campbell remained undefeated on eight runs from nine balls.  The two Chevrons wickets that fell were taken by Shakib Al Hasan and Mohammad Saifuddin. They had figures of 1/9 and 1/55 respectively both in four overs.  It was an encounter that Bennett bossed with both bat and ball while Raza rediscovered his form. – @brandon_malvin     "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/arsenal-beat-utd-to-return-on-top/,Arsenal beat Utd to return on top,"Arsenal returned to the top of the Premier League and ensured the title race will go to the final day with victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. The Gunners delivered an unconvincing display against a severely depleted United side but did enough to secure the win that puts them one point ahead of Manchester City having played a game more. Leandro Trossard struck after 20 minutes when lazy defending from struggling veteran Casemiro played Kai Havertz onside and his cross was turned in by the Belgian at the near post. United showed plenty of endeavour but suffered from a glaring lack of quality and never seriously tested Arsenal keeper David Raya, as their own hopes of European football next season faded further. Arsenal must now hope north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur do them a favour by getting a result at home to Manchester City on Tuesday. The Gunners host Everton in their final game of the season next Sunday, while City are at home to West Ham. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe chose to cast another eye over Erik ten Hag’s struggling side rather than travel to Wembley to watch United win the Women’s FA Cup for the first time. It is hard to work out what Ratcliffe would have learned from watching another home defeat — other than it simply re-affirming the size of the job he has on his hands lifting this fallen football giant. United’s squad, hardly fit for purpose when all players are available, was stripped of key assets such as captain Bruno Fernandes, who watched from the directors’ box with a pained expression.  Ten Hag, his smart suit soaked by a torrential downpour amid a thunderstorm that hit Old Trafford late on, will point to his lack of resources – and rightly so on this occasion. But the fact United were unable to cause Arsenal keeper Raya any serious problems was a sobering lesson in the current state of the Red Devils. Kobbie Mainoo tried to galvanise the hosts’ midfield while Alejandro Garnacho ran tirelessly out wide, but it was a tough afternoon for young striker Rasmus Hojlund, who got very little change out of Arsenal defensive duo William Saliba and Gabriel. United are a club that needs a reboot and re-invigoration and – while this was not the day to make judgements on Ten Hag – it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how the Dutchman can be part of the new era and structure under Ratcliffe. The elation of Arsenal’s fans at this vital win was not dampened by the storm that arrived in Manchester just before the final whistle as skies darkened and lightning flashed around the stadium. Arsenal know Manchester City’s fate still lies in the champions’ own hands and two wins against Spurs and West Ham will take a fourth successive title to Etihad Stadium. Mikel Arteta’s side, however, have done all they can and two hazardous-looking fixtures — away to Spurs in the north London derby and here at United, where they have suffered before — have been safely negotiated. No matter that this was an Arsenal display lacking their usual fluency — at this stage of the season the only currency that counts is wins and the visitors did the job. Once again Trossard made the difference with a trademark swoop at the near post ahead of Casemiro and Aaron Wan-Bissaka for the decisive moment. Arsenal will now hope Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou is as good as his word and they can somehow raise themselves to upset City. The Gunners still have a chance of their first title in 20 years going into the final game of the season – and they would have happily settled for that in August. – BBC Sport   "

I’ve been incredibly proud of the team and what we’ve achieved during this transitional season. In keeping with the whole Jurgen Klopp era, it’s been an emotional journey with ups and downs – but you can’t say for one moment that it’s been boring. We’re still a team who play with heart and soul, even during the moments when it’s not going our way. With that in mind, my Player of the Season award goes to a man who knows adversity well – and that’s Joe Gomez. He’s stepped up to the plate time and time again when needed and put in some crucial performances across the campaign. I think his strength of character and devotion to the club has been unparalleled on and off the pitch. Ain’t nobody, like Joe Gomez. Andrew Cullen
The team’s performance over the season has ebbed and flowed. Dominik Szoboszlai’s blistering start to the season was followed by an indifferent end to it. Darwin Nunez has looked world class on occasion, but far too often he has lacked composure in front of goal. Luiz Diaz, on the other hand, has continued to shine throughout the season. It’s true that he has been guilty of spurning chances, but he has continued to be influential in games and his sheer tenacity and work ethic is always evident. His performances have been all the more impressive when we recall how much of a turbulent year he has had off the pitch. There were some whispers that the front three would need to be replaced next year, but insofar as those whispers have any substance, it would be a grave mistake to lose the creative Colombian. Although Diaz has taken the crown for my Player of the Season, I should say that Virgil Van Dijk was a close contender. He has been imperious this year. His comments this week about his commitment to the new club project was a real lift, in what has been an underwhelming end to the season. Picking this year’s player of the season isn’t as straightforward as it seems. Seasons are long, but this felt longer than others, and it was hard to pick out a single player who has consistently stood out. Early on it was the Hungarian Dominik Szoboszlai – he couldn’t put a foot wrong. A case can be made for Caoimhin Kelleher, who deputised brilliantly in Alisson’s absence, and Conor Bradley made a superb showing, replacing an injured Trent Alexander-Arnold. But those were temporary. One of the most surprising turns was the performance of the unheralded signing, Wataru Endo. By the time December rolled around, he had become my player of 2023. But I must admit, I made that choice partly because it was a less obvious one. Trent Alexander-Arnold, perhaps? But this season didn’t quite feel like his. Mohamed Salah, of course, should be in the conversation, but do we give it to him by default? Virgil van Dijk stepped up during his first season as captain, but our defensive frailties saw our title challenge curtailed in April. If push comes to shove, I’ll have to go with the Argentine Alexis Mac Allister. His star has consistently shined the brightest for the longest time. He is always there, always putting in a shift and rarely plays abysmal football. It’s pleasingly tough to choose a Liverpool Player of the Season. Good cases can be made for several: Alexis Mac Allister, for instance, has offered consistent composure and class within different midfield roles; Jarell Quansah has taken to senior football with such smoothness and steeliness; while Mohamed Salah has now exceeded 35 goal involvements in each of his seven seasons at the club. I’ve gone for Virgil van Dijk, though. Having been appointed captain within an eventful summer, the Dutchman has risen to the additional responsibility. It’s easy to forget that there were questions aplenty around how the squad would function after last season’s challenges and the departures of former skipper Jordan Henderson and vice-captain James Milner. Van Dijk’s 2023/24 levels have been among the highest of his Liverpool career, which is saying something. In and out of possession, defending high or deep, he’s represented a linchpin in the midst of regular rotation. We’ve also watched him score, of course, including that raucous Carabao Cup final winner – arguably the moment of the season. Getting Jurgen Klopp to lift the trophy with him is a decision that’s aged well. Extending our No.4’s contract beyond 2025 is rightly seen as a priority. – yahoosports Only two games remain in Liverpool’s 2023/24 season.

https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-cyber-city-president-mnangagwas-game-changing-masterpiece-set-to-transform-zimbabwes-future/,"Zimbabwe Cyber City, President Mnangagwa’s game-changing masterpiece set to transform Zimbabwe’s future","Stanford Chiwanga, [email protected]  THE creation of Zim Cyber City will usher in a new era of economic and social development for Zimbabwe. Under the visionary leadership of President Mnangagwa, this ambitious project holds the promise of transforming the country into a vibrant and attractive destination for tourists and foreign investors alike. The cyber city, bankrolled by Mulk International, will make Zimbabwe the first African country with a “smart” capital city built from scratch. Just outside the present-day capital, New Harare or Zim Cyber City in Mount Hampden, is slated to become a state-of-the-art artificially intelligent city with interconnected government buildings, smooth traffic, round-the-clock security, prime real estate, and top-notch malls.  President Mnangagwa’s support and approval of the US$500 million Zim Cyber City project showcases his dedication to spearheading transformative projects in the country. The ambitious endeavour has the potential to become his crowning glory among the various development initiatives undertaken during his tenure. By aligning Zimbabwe with a multinational conglomerate like Mulk International, the President has shown a keen understanding of the power of strategic partnerships. The collaboration brings together the expertise, resources, and global recognition of Mulk International with the President’s vision for a prosperous and modern Zimbabwe.  One of the key benefits of Zim Cyber City is its potential to boost tourism in the country. With its state-of-the-art infrastructure and world-class amenities, the city will attract visitors from all over the globe.  The inclusion of a duty-free mall and high-end residential living will create a sophisticated and luxurious environment, catering to the discerning tastes of tourists seeking an elevated experience. The availability of pre-approved mortgages from banks in US dollars is a groundbreaking move that will facilitate investment and attract a diverse range of tourists and investors. “We have been trying to bring the Dubai standard of living to this particular development. The project will have high-end villas, we call them Zim Hills, surrounding water bodies. We will have a very tall tower with the shopping centre,” said Shaji ul Mulk, the Mulk International chairman last year.  Moreover, Zim Cyber City’s integration into the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) programme highlights the Government’s commitment to promoting sustainable growth and attracting investments. The SEZ status ensures fast-track clearances for foreign direct investments, making it easier for businesses to establish themselves in  Zimbabwe. This streamlined process will undoubtedly encourage both local and international companies to invest in the country, fostering economic growth and job creation. Infrastructure development is another crucial aspect of Zim Cyber City’s impact on Zimbabwe’s progress. The project encompasses a vast area and includes the construction of high-end residential and commercial buildings, complemented by the newly completed Parliament building and ministry buildings. This comprehensive development plan demonstrates a commitment to modernising and revitalising Zimbabwe’s infrastructure, providing a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. “The investment by the UAE (United Arab Emirates) investor in the Smart City Project is quite instrumental from the economic development point of view. “So of course we expect businesses to benefit, local businesses to benefit out of that employment creation and the development of basic infrastructure. We are seeing a huge infrastructure gap in Zimbabwe and we think that those kinds of investments would actually catapult us in reaching our Vision 2030 objectives to be a middle-income nation,” said Batanai Matsika, the head of research, Morgan & Co.  In addition to its economic benefits, Zim Cyber City aims to enhance the beauty and attractiveness of Zimbabwe. The modern architectural designs, high-tech surveillance systems, and meticulously planned community spaces will create a visually stunning  and secure environment. As the city flourishes, it will serve as a testament to Zimbabwe’s potential and allure, enticing foreign investors and tourists to explore the country’s many offerings.  The project’s emphasis on sustainability and technological innovation is another aspect that sets Zim Cyber City apart. The incorporation of advanced surveillance technology directly connected to law enforcement authorities ensures the safety and security of residents and visitors. Additionally, the city’s commitment to green building practices and renewable energy sources will contribute to environmental conservation and position Zimbabwe as a leader in sustainable development. Zim Cyber City’s success will not be limited to its immediate surroundings. Its impact will extend beyond the city’s borders, leading to the improvement of infrastructure and services in other parts of Zimbabwe. The Government, recognising the potential of the project, will likely allocate resources to upgrade transportation networks, communication systems, and utilities to support the growth of Zim Cyber City and accommodate the increased demand from tourists and businesses. The project’s partnership with Mulk International also brings a wealth of expertise, experience, and global connections to Zimbabwe. The collaboration will foster knowledge transfer, skill development, and technology exchange, which will benefit local industries and contribute to the country’s long-term economic growth. “The development of Zim Cyber City will have a ripple effect on the overall economy of the country. As the city thrives, it will create numerous job opportunities across various sectors, including construction, hospitality, retail, and services. The influx of new businesses and investments will spur economic growth and contribute to the overall prosperity of the country,” Marshall Ndlela, an economic analyst says. Moreover, the success of Zim Cyber City will create a positive image for Zimbabwe on the global stage. The city’s modern infrastructure, high-quality amenities, and commitment to sustainable development will showcase Zimbabwe’s potential and attractiveness as an investment destination. This positive perception will not only draw in foreign investors but also boost the country’s tourism industry, attracting visitors who will explore other attractions and contribute to local businesses across Zimbabwe.  Without a doubt, President Mnangagwa’s support for Zim Cyber City reflects his Government’s commitment to driving economic development and attracting foreign investments. By spearheading this transformative project, he demonstrates his leadership and vision for a prosperous Zimbabwe. The successful completion and operation of Zim Cyber City will stand as a testament to his administration’s efforts in promoting economic growth, job creation, and the overall improvement of the country’s living standards. A lot can be said about Zim Cyber City, in short, it holds immense potential for economic and social development for Zimbabwe. With its focus on tourism, infrastructure development, and strategic partnerships, the city is poised to become a catalyst for growth, attracting foreign investments, creating jobs, and enhancing the country’s overall image. Under President Mnangagwa’s leadership, this ambitious project may indeed become his crowning glory, solidifying his Government’s legacy in driving sustainable national development and prosperity. — @plainstan "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/govt-moves-a-gear-up-to-realise-vision-2030/,Govt moves a gear up to realise Vision 2030,"Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau
THE Government has moved a gear up in operationalising the principles of devolution to push economic and sustainable development from community to national level to realise Vision 2030. The vision, as enunciated by President Mnangagwa, is to turn the country into an upper-middle-class economy by that year. This was said by the minister responsible for Monitoring and Evaluation in the Office of the President, Dr Joram Gumbo while touring an amacimbi/madora processing plant in the Matshiloni area of Beitbridge. He said devolution demanded that provincial authorities be empowered to spearhead economic and social development in their jurisdictions by leveraging local resources. “In this regard, my office will work closely with the provinces to ensure that provincial flagship projects are successfully implemented through the Rapid Results Initiative. The Government has also adopted the 100-day target-based program to expedite project implementation and to address anomalies associated with project implementation,” said Dr Gumbo. He said the revival of the country’s economic fortunes needed everyone’s support including those in the Government and the private sector. Dr Gumbo said in the past most Government projects’ implementation was hindered by various sector performance deficiencies hence the need for a phased work programme. “The adoption of the 100-day target-based programme symbolises the Government’s commitment to expeditiously implement projects for the benefit of citizens. My previous visits to different projects under the programme bear testimony that Rapid Results Approach is yielding positive results and is contributing to the improvement of the livelihoods of our people,” said the Minister. He said the Government was intent on ensuring that the 100-day target-based programme will lead to the realisation of development goals set out in the Transitional Stabilisation Programme which will be succeeded today by the National Development Strategy 1. Dr Gumbo commended the Rovhona Raita Co-operative in Beitbridge which initiated the setting up of the amacimbi and multi-purpose processing plant. He said the project fitted well into the devolution concept which promotes the economic growth of local economies driven by resources within different communities. “Zimbabwe has the potential to earn significant revenue from the export of mopane worms (amacimbi) to Europe, Japan, and other countries in the region where they are highly sought after.
“These (amacimbi) are rich in various nutrients, according to food experts and these are areas therefore where we have a comparative advantage but we are not making use of it,” said the Minister. He said it was very critical for the Government to avail resources to construct the requisite infrastructure to promote the growth of small to medium enterprises nationwide. Dr Gumbo said the processing of amacimbi and other horticulture produce was in line with the thrust of the Government to promote value addition and beneficiation. He said the plant will not only boost employment but will also reduce post-harvest losses, transportation costs, provide proper grading infrastructure and address the problem of depressed prices, especially among small-scale traders. “The plant will also play a critical role in addressing hygiene issues associated with the processing of amacimbi and thereby empowering local traders to be competitive. “At the same time, we are concerned with the case of deforestation where some people cut down trees to harvest amacimbi. This is unacceptable, we need to review the harvesting methodologies and also create mopane tree nurseries to replenish the natural resources,” said Dr Gumbo. — @tupeyo "

THE rate with which Government is moving in implementing works at the Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme in Binga District, reflects the serious approach to development and commitment towards creating employment and alleviating poverty through transforming the area into an economic hub. The irrigation scheme will transform the district, previously viewed as lagging behind in terms of development despite its vast potential. It is envisaged that the irrigation scheme, which is currently being expanded to cover 15 000 hectares, will promote food and nutrition security in the country, which is reeling under the effects of climate change and recurrent drought. The Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (Arda) has since entered into a joint venture with a local private company to put 15 000 hectares of land under food and export crops as well as crocodile farming. The New Dispensation led by President Mnangagwa has released funds for the completion of the projects at Bulawayo Kraal with a lot of work currently underway. Bulawayo Kraal pump house engines Already 467 pipes for the mainline linking the engine water pumps from the Zambezi River to the overnight storage dams have been delivered with three centre pivots having been rehabilitated at the scheme. Another overnight storage dam and pump engine houses are almost complete. An engine pump with a capacity to pump 315 cubic metres of water per hour has been installed in the Zambezi River. At least 200 hectares of land has been cleared for the summer cropping season. Government has since engaged an on-site engineering consultant Mr Paul Kruger to offer technical assistance. Under the Second Republic, Government is prioritising the revival of the agricultural sector through the development of irrigation schemes to alleviate food insecurity and poverty particularly in rural communities. Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga’s countless visits to the irrigation scheme to assess progress, reflects the New Dispensation’s commitment to fulfilling the devolution agenda. Speaking during his tour to assess progress on the implementation of ongoing works at Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme on Sunday, V P Chiwenga said Government will not tire in ensuring that there is enough food in the country as evidenced by the recently launched Agriculture and Food Systems Transformation Strategy. President Mnangagwa launched the programme whose aim is to provide a compass for agriculture in line with Vision 2030. Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme pipes VP Chiwenga said the Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme remains one of the Government’s key priorities. The Minister of State for Matabeleland North Richard Moyo said the rehabilitation of Bulawayo Kraal highlights Government’s commitment in ensuring that communities living in areas surrounded by water bodies benefit from their natural resources. “The revival of Bulawayo Kraal signifies the commitment by Government under the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa to transform lives of rural communities. This massive project, which has for a long time been lying idle has got a new lease of life and people in Binga and surrounding areas will certainly reap rewards from the vast water in the Zambezi River,” he said. “This project marks a new dawn for people in the district and surrounding areas as it represents a significant turnaround and economic transformation, not only for Binga, but the entire province.” Established in 1996 after local villagers from Manjolo and Siachilaba approached Government for assistance in terms of developing an irrigation scheme to cushion them from the adverse effects of drought, Bulawayo Kraal faced a series of challenges in terms of funding. However, with the coming of the New Dispensation, the face of Bulawayo Kraal has changed. The revitalisation of Bulawayo Kraal is in line with President Mnangagwa’s thrust to ensure the realisation of Matabeleland North’s full economic potential in line with the devolution policy. Chief Sikalenge, in whose jurisdiction Bulawayo Kraal falls under, said the ongoing expansion works at the irrigation scheme were a positive development for the district. “We have Zambezi River but for a long time we failed to utilise the water from that water body. What we are witnessing at Bulawayo Kraal is a positive development and a reflection of our Government’s commitment to addressing poverty and hunger and it will transform lives in Binga,” he said. The resuscitation of the country’s agricultural sector remains vital to improving the livelihoods of ordinary Zimbabweans and irrigation development could be the answer as climate change has affected rainfall patterns. However, only three percent of the country’s agricultural activity is under irrigation and this has had a negative impact on output, highlighting the urgent need to put more effort in irrigation development. The resuscitation of Bulawayo Kraal has also brought smiles to the locals. Mrs Florence Munsaka of Manjolo said they were hoping to reap economic benefits once the irrigation scheme is fully operational as they venture into sustainable projects. “As locals, we have pinned our hopes on the rehabilitation of Bulawayo Kraal and once it is up and running everyone will benefit and there will be employment for us so that we take care of their families, especially at such a time when we are facing starvation due to drought,” she said. Another villager, Mr Peter Muleya said the irrigation scheme has been lying idle for a very long time despite the abundance of water in the Zambezi River. “We are quite grateful to the Government for this gesture and it is our hope that through this project everyone will benefit. We are particularly looking at farming and if we can get small plots and there will also be a lot of employment opportunities for our children since there is an investor who has been roped in by Government to develop the project,” he said. “The irrigation scheme will boost food security and ensure that we move from subsistence towards prosperity as there will be a lot of commercial farming activities.” Already Government, under the Agriculture Recovery Plan, has set aside 100 000 hectares of land, which will be transformed into a greenbelt with an anticipated yield of at least 1 million tonnes of maize within the next three years. The massive project — to be implemented at Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme in Binga, Matabeleland North, in the lowveld areas of Masvingo and Kanyemba in Mashonaland Central — will be done in phases and will boost food production and alleviate food shortages in the country largely attributed to recurrent drought. Government is roping in the private sector in the programme. Under the programme, 100  000 hectares of virgin land will be opened up in the three identified provinces. The programme will also help in cutting imports and accelerate the attainment of Vision 2030 goals. — @mashnets "

TWO telecommunications giants NetOne and TelOne have refurbished a 35-bed ward at Mpilo Central Hospital as part of the $10 million project to help the Government fight Covid-19 at public institutions. The $10 million was set aside last April by the two companies to refurbish Mpilo, Beatrice Infectious Disease Hospital and Sally Mugabe Hospital. The ward B5 investment is said to be the biggest ever at Mpilo and will enable members of the public to access state-of-the-art monitors which will enable medical personnel to detect patients’ blood pressure, temperature and pulse from the same machine which is quicker than the traditional method of using different types of equipment. Part of the refurbishment also include new bedding and linen. Now with grey and white walls and new curtains, B5 which is mainly for men, will be reserved for Covid-19 patients if the need arises. The two companies also replaced all sinks, taps, bath tubs and tiled the floors. Deputy Minister of Information Communication Technology (ICT), Postal and Courier Services Dingu-muzi Phuti (second from left) officially opens Ward B5 at Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo yesterday. The Minister of State for Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Cde Judith Ncube (left), Deputy Minister of Health and Child Care Dr John Mangwiro (right), NetOne, TelOne officials and hospital staff clap hands in jubilation The ward also has colourful nurse stations, bed numbers and room labels made from stickers with TelOne and NetOne logos. B5 ward is now decorated with huge frames with NetOne and TelOne colours which include black, orange, blue and white. Before the refurbishment, the ward which is part of the 10 other wards within the main hospital built in 1958, had cracked floors, old bath tubs, sinks and taps which were difficult to repair due to resource challenges. Speaking at the handover ceremony of the fully equipped and refurbished Ward B5 yesterday, ICT, Postal and Courier Services Minister Jenfan Muswere said it was imperative for corporates to assist the Government by mobilising resources towards mitigation and containment in times of crisis. He said the ministry and companies under its purview had accelerated digital innovations that seek to promote telecommuting or remote working. In a speech read on his behalf by his Deputy Cde Dingumuzi Phuti, Minister Muswere said he was committed to increasing support towards the fight against Covid-19 and other healthcare challenges. “This commitment was pledged to his Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, at State House in April this year,” said Minister Muswere. “A fortnight ago we were at Sally Mugabe Hospital witnessing the fantastic work by NetOne and TelOne, and today I am excited to be unveiling a newly refurbished 35-bed Ward B5 here at Mpilo Hospital.” Our economic recovery as a nation, he added, will be leveraged on rebuilding through smart technologies premised on ICTs. Deputy Minister Phuti (picture right) is having his blood pressure taken as other officials curiously look on The two companies are working on drilling six boreholes for Mpilo, Sally Mugabe Hospital and Beatrice Infectious Diseases Hospital set to reduce the number of people contracting Covid-19. Speaking during the same handover, deputy Minister of Health and Child Care Dr John Mangwiro called on other corporates to chip in and help the Government improve public health institutions. “Today as we accept the refurbished Ward B5, the new furniture and equipment together with the drilled borehole and water tanks provided, I would also want to acknowledge the Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) which was donated earlier in May. I am aware all this is part of your Covid-19 response package which you announced through a symbolic ZWL$10-million cheque handover to His Excellency, President Mnangagwa,” he said. According to Dr Mangwiro, Covid-19 impact in terms of serious illnesses and morbidity had been relatively low but preparations to respond and manage the pandemic had not been easy for the country. “While they announced the intervention to be pegged at ZWL$10 million, I know the amount has already almost doubled due to inflation with costs for Mpilo Hospital projects alone at ZWL$5,2 million. Indeed, the sincerity of both companies to see the fullness of this project is evident as you continued with your works despite the increase in the budget.” Dr Mangwiro said the refurbished ward will also come in handy in the fight against Covid-19 which has claimed 225 lives so far and other prevalent diseases in Zimbabwe. “While faced with this, we also have other diseases like cancer, malaria, HIV-Aids which remain alive and need management by the same hospitals. Maternal and paediatric health are also areas that remain key on our health radar. It is therefore delighting to note the ward refurbishment and borehole drilling initiatives will live beyond the challenges of the moment,” he said. NetOne chief executive officer Ms Chipo Jaisson said it was the company’s mission to transform lives and develop communities by providing support towards improving the health and well being of Zimbabweans. “We understand that the current state of our public health care sector impacts on the ability and level of preparedness to deal with Covid-19. We are confident that the newly refurbished and modernised ward being unveiled today will make our public health facilities more appealing and allow them to accommodate more patients in a clean and ecstatic environment as well as provide affordable health care to the general populace that may not be able to access private health care,” said Ms Jaisson. She said NetOne’s One-health initiative is linked to the sustainable development goal (SDG) plan which seeks to ensure healthy lives by providing water and sanitation for all. TelOne managing director Mrs Chipo Mtasa said the partnership with NetOne has seen the telecommunication companies bring joy to many vulnerable communities in Zimbabwe. “We also have the Covid-19 rural health facilities programme running which has reached rural clinics in 13 districts with Covid-19 response packages including PPEs for frontline staff and other materials. Just last week we were in Matopo and Ndolwane where such donations were made,” said Mrs Mtasa. “I call on other corporates to consider partnering the Ministry of Health and Child Care so that we can all play our part in transforming the country’s health sector.” "

THE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) will soon issue a directive to facilitate smooth repatriation of capital and dividends by foreign investors, which will buttress the ease of doing business in the country. Treasury is pushing the matter in response to investor concerns over the country’s exchange and capital controls, which are perceived to be a stumbling block to attracting foreign direct investment. Finance and Economic Development Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube told a recent virtual market analyst briefing on the establishment of the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) that the challenge of repatriating funds was being addressed following lengthy discussions with the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) executives and the RBZ. He said the framework, to be soon tabled by the Central Bank, will also give impetus to the successful operationalisation of an offshore capital market in the form of VFEX, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the ZSE. The minister was responding to sub-Saharan Africa economist at Renaissance Capital, Yvonne Mhango, who said the difficulty in repatriating funds was a big investor concern that Zimbabwe needs to urgently resolve. “It makes sense initially to make our central bank, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, involved more directly in the settlement process. That is being fine-tuned and that will be the case, the reason being to deal directly with what Yvonne raised,” said Prof Ncube. “We want guarantees that there will be full conversion and there is commitment from the Government and RBZ that the foreign currency will be made available. “That’s why we want RBZ to be involved initially (at VFEX) but over time other banks with strong balance sheets and skills would also be involved.” Given that VFEX will be denominated in the United States dollar, investors are keen to get guarantees on the ease to repatriate their dividends unlike what is happening on ZSE now, said Mhango. ZSE chief executive officer, Mr Justin Bgoni, who also attended the webinar, concurred with Prof Ncube. “This is one of the areas where we have put in a lot of work on, especially with the Central Bank. Shortly the central bank will be issuing out a directive that will address a lot of these concerns including how investment can be done on the exchange,” he said. “A lot of that will be very clear, it would be easy for foreign investors to come in and go out. Without disclosing much because we are finalising the discussion with the reserve bank, what I can promise is that the Reserve bank has been very forthcoming, they understand this concern and the directive that will come will be very clear. “I can promise it will be easy for investors to come in and easy for them to repatriate funds.” VFEX was recently issued with a licence and would be denominated in foreign currency. It targets foreign investors as well as global capital markets especially the mining industry. Government is already engaged in ongoing discussions with several international investment financiers to support VFEX that will trade exclusively in foreign currency. "

PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday officially launched the National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy as he led the re-start of the sector, whose contribution to the national economy has been heavily crippled by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The President also officially re-opened the Victoria Falls Rainforest, signalling readiness for the country to welcome visitors into the prime resort destination. The tourism and hospitality industry is one of the key foreign currency earners in the country and employs thousands of people along the value chain. The President also opened Mbano Manor Hotel Despite the Covid-19 dent on arrivals, Zimbabwe expects to leverage on internal competencies around domestic tourism to unlock wider potential and enhancing operators’ capacities on the interim. In this regard, the National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy will seek to provide increased funding to affected tourism businesses, including small to medium players within the tourism value chain through a Tourism Revolving Fund. Officially launching the strategy document here, President Mnangagwa said the tourism sector has an important role to play in the attainment of the National Vision as one of the four pillars underpinning economic growth alongside agriculture, mining and manufacturing. “The National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy we are launching today, is anchored on Zimbabwe’s vision to be a prime international tourist destination based in the judicious and sustainable exploitation of the unique assets of nature, culture, heritage and the built environment. Dr Matifadza Nyazema shows off one of the bathrooms at her hotel “The strategy is informed by the Government’s Vision 2030 to become an upper middle income economy characterised by increased investment, decent jobs and populace free from poverty and corruption,” said the President. “The high growth target of this strategy, which seeks to achieve a US$5 billion tourism economy by year 2025 is ambitious and yet achievable. “This strategy will also facilitate robust investment into the tourism sector to create employment and help support livelihoods.” As such, President Mnangagwa challenged players in the sector to work harder to achieve increased domestic and international tourist arrivals, room occupancy and higher tourist expenditures. He said the new strategy focus requires industry players to be creative and innovative by offering the target markets new products and services that continuously give the country a competitive edge in the region and globally. Already Government has availed a $500 million guarantee facility for access by the sector to support Covid-19 affected entities to stay afloat and save jobs. The initiative is part of the $18 billion Stimulus Package recently unveiled by Treasury in response to the pandemic. The tourism sector also enjoys value added tax exemption for a year on products offered locally as part of cushioning measures for the sector. In view of increased Government support to the industry, President Mnangagwa called on the tourism sector to “re-examine its pricing models” in order to complement the need for tourists to enjoy benefits of products on offer. He also encouraged locals to explore and enjoy the vast tourism destinations and products throughout the country.  Earlier, President Mnangagwa led a ministerial delegation on a tour of the Victoria Falls Rainforest before officially re-opening it. He was accompanied by Cabinet ministers Professor Mthuli Ncube (Finance and Economic Development), Dr Sithembiso Nyoni (Women Affairs and SMEs), July Moyo (Local Government), Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri (Defence), Owen Ncube (State Security), Mangaliso Ndlovu (Tourism), Matabeleland North Provincial Minister Richard Moyo, Deputy Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet George Charamba and several senior Government officials. The world heritage site, through which tourists get to view the mighty Victoria Falls, was closed for 100 days following the outbreak of Covid-19 as part of national mitigation efforts against the spread of the pandemic. President Mnangagwa said while the lockdown period has crippled arrivals, it has led to the reinvigoration of the falls themselves and the renewal of the ecosystem and the surrounding enviroment. During the tour the Presidential delegation and business players observed with more joy that the water level at the falls had risen to breaking level, an indication of how Zimbabwe remains attractive and enjoyable to the local and global visitor. President Mnangagwa, however, stressed the need for the country to remain vigilant while opening up the tourism sector by strictly adhering to health and safety guidelines stipulated by the World Health Organisation to curb Covid-19 infections. Earlier in his address, Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu, said the launch of the new tourism recovery strategy was historic. Coming on the back of a projected tourism drop in arrivals and loss of billions in potential revenue globally, there was a need to come up with urgent measures to counter the impact hence the strategy launch. As it stands now, like all other sectors of the economy, tourism has to look inward for survival. In the absence of regional and international tourist arrivals, the industry has to place its focus on domestic tourism in order to preserve jobs and livelihoods,” said Minister Ndlovu. He said the strategy document details the implementation matrix towards growth and recovery, which is set to be tested by results. “We will not be deterred by the virus. We, therefore, remain hopeful that the tourism industry will rise again and our vision of a US$5 billion tourism economy will be attained,” said the minister. "

ZIMBABWEAN women should gain inspiration from aggressive entrepreneurs like Dr Matifadza Nyazema who has fought hard to establish one of the country’s top locally-owned hospitality facilities in the resort town of Victoria Falls. The official opening of the Mbano Manor Hotel here yesterday by President Mnangagwa was historic and iconic, as the unique luxury boutique hotel was conceptualised and developed by a black female Zimbabwean. The launch of the US$8 million facility was part of the critical programme by the President in launching the National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy. The new hotel is an all-suite premium luxury property that was completed early this year and comprises of 19 suites, including a masterpiece forest villa. The uniqueness of the investment lies in the sustainable co-existence of the hotel with nature. The hotel is located within the ancient teak forest of the Zambezi National Park and only two trees were taken down in its development, ensuring that the natural forest remains intact. Its exterior design embraces the effortless countryside yet modern taste defined by large bungalow architecture, open flowing public areas and imposing verandas. “This indeed is the most magnificent place I have ever been. Most importantly we are both in the bush as well as in the first world,” said President Mnangagwa amid applause from the gathering, as he officially opened the business after leading a ministerial delegation on a tour of the unique facility. “Women of Zimbabwe have raised the bar above. It is pleasing that this mammoth investment was put together by a local company, Matizimunda Investments. “I commend the admirable high standard of workmanship and products that are on show on this facility. This will undoubtedly help attract the target market and clientele for the hotel.” The President described the facility as “elegant” saying it was gratifying that Dr Nyazema in her design sought to maximise investment that is socially and enviromentally friendly. But who is Dr Nyazema and what inspires her? She is an award winning and tourism and hotel professional, with over 30 years of hospitality experience including involvement in global travel companies and hotel start-ups across several countries. “I have travelled to over 60 countries during my career and stayed at some of the best signature hotels in the world. “What you see as Mbano Hotel today is the culmination of this experience, yet engineered by an expert design and architecturial team to blend with our natural environment. Attention to detail defines the Mbano experience,” said the eloquent and bold Dr Nyazema. “We complement the existing accommodation product in and around Victoria Falls. Our aim is to open up new and additional markets for the benefit of the destination and the country.” One of the trends driving the future of luxury travel is the shift in values from the material to the experiential. “Rather than saving up to buy luxurious possessions, people are choosing to spend their money on experience. Mbano Manor is positioning itself to take up this opportunity in Zimbabwe and the region,” said Dr Nyazema, who is a devoted Christian and is married to Professor Norman Nyazema Another milestone for the hotel is that local pension funds funded its development, over and above the initial injection of feasibility funding that was provided by an international investor. “We applaud and are grateful for the demonstration of confidence by local institutions. In particular, Hippo Valley and Triangle Pension Funds, who endorsed our vision considering this was an entrpreneurial venture,” she said. “Additional funding was also later obtained from the Standard Chartered Pension fund, and from two Minerva pension funds.” Dr Nyazema said the journey to deliver a world class product was not easy and she and her family faced many challenges but remained focused on their goal. Belief in her vision was key to her success. “We didn’t compromise on developing the hotel product that was initially envisaged. My research and experience in tourism convinced me that there is a market gap in the luxury boutique product at Victoria Falls that Mbano can fill. Several people said this idea would not fly because the site is not next to the Zambezi River nor the Rainforest. My global perspective said it was possible,” she said. Dr Nyazema paid tribute to her family and their small staff complement for the support towards realising the vision as well as Governement for assisting in making key breakthroughs. "

GOVERNMENT has engaged China to facilitate the return of experts and engineers stuck in that country since the outbreak of Covid-19 to ensure speedy completion of capital projects being implemented in the country, President Mnangagwa said yesterday. Speaking on the second day of his tour of coal projects here, President Mnangagwa said big projects like the Hwange Power Station Unit 7 and 8 expansion and the Gwayi-Shangani Dam project, which had been stalled by the pandemic, will get required expertise to carry on. He said most engineers had returned to China in January for their country’s New Year holiday and failed to return after countries imposed lockdowns and grounded flights to prevent the transmission and spread of the pandemic. The President said the facility will see the experts being flown in a dedicated flight and quarantined at the respective projects that they are attached to so that they continue with work afterwards. “A few days ago, I had discussions with the Chinese Ambassador and we came to an understanding where we can now airlift most of the experts who are detained in China as a result of the pandemic to come to Zimbabwe to the various companies to which they are attached and then they will go through their quarantine at the respective companies,” said President Mnangagwa. “We believe that Hwange Unit 7 and 8 again will have the level of expertise and competencies it requires made available.” President Mnangagwa kicked off his tour at Dinson Colliery before moving to ZZCC and Zambezi Gas and Makomo Resources. He concluded his tour by visiting ZZEE where he witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the company and Zimbabwe Mining Development Cooperation. “The future is brighter than the past because the Government is giving focus on the mining sector. We have given ourselves goals to achieve in the mining sector. We have agreed that we need to move from US$2 billion to US$12 billion in the sector in the next three years,” said President Mnangagwa. “We are satisfied that we can achieve that goal and possibly exceed what we have set ourselves.” President Mnangagwa said he was happy that indigenous owned mines like Makomo Resources and Zambezi Coal and Gas were doing well. He said Makomo Resources in particular resources would play a key role in providing input into Unit 7 and 8 as a top supplier to the power station. The President called in the two indigenously owned mines to stop quarrelling over the use of a road that passes through Makomo Resources, giving them up to the end of the month to find a common understating, failure to which the Government would intervene. President Mnangagwa (second right) and his delegation visits Zambezi Gas company during his tour of Matabeleland North coal and gas mining companies “Be assured from me that as long as you remain focused and patriotic to your country, you have my Government’s support. All what you need now is a roadmap for expansion and to do so yes, you will need private capital to assist you but you also need us in the public sector in your programmes in order to support you in your set goals,” said the President. President Mnangagwa reiterated that the mining and agricultural sectors were critical in achievement of Vision 2030 as the country has competitive advantage in these segments “Those of our people in mining and agriculture be aware that we as Government are looking on you, are depending on you in particular to achieve our goal. In general, all other sub sectors of the economy must contribute towards that achievement but because with regard to mining everything is here, agriculture, the agricultural land is at our disposal and we have sovereign ownership of land and resources and it is us who determine how we exploit that resource,” he said. Despite persistent drought conditions, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe has an excess of 10 000 water bodies to sustain a vibrant irrigation model but expressed dismay that only 25 percent are being used. He revealed that there is a massive irrigation programme on the cards to ensure full utilisation of the water bodies and that in the next two to three seasons the country would no longer experience food insecurity. President Mnangagwa said countries like Spain and Belarus were supporting Zimbabwe in agriculture mechanisation and that going forward the country must have no excuse for food shortages. For the Government to achieve food security it needs to assist farmers towards smart agriculture, he added. “We must begin to move forward on the basis of the things that are under our control, the pace and the speed is determined by ourselves . . . We can force production of coal because its ours, we can force the production of food because the land is ours,” said the President. To achieve this, President Mnangagwa stressed the need for the country to be united and remain peaceful. “Let us all feel we are wanted and important and we have commitment to the development of our country. Let us all be patriotic to the development of our country because no one will come from elsewhere to develop it,” he said. The President also took time to address Zanu-PF supporters who had gathered at Dinson Colliery and ZZEE telling them that the investors would also work towards the uplifting of communities. He said he visited China in 2018 and his counterpart Xi Xinping invited companies interested in working in Zimbabwe. “They will also build you schools, roads, clinics and also provide clean water to uplift the communities on top of employing the local youths,” he said. Meanwhile, President Mnangagwa donated 2000 tonnes of coke peas he was given by Makomo Resources to Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo. He also directed Matabeleland North Minister for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Richard Moyo to distribute one million bricks, also given to him by Makomo Resources, to the local community in consultation with chiefs and councils for developmental projects. The President was accompanied by Ministers of Mines and Mining Development Winston Chitando, Finance and Economic Development Professor Mthuli Ncube, Environment Climate Tourism and Hospitality Industry Nqobizitha Ndlovu, Industry and Commerce Dr Sekai Nzenza and Women Affairs, Community and Small and Medium Enterprises Development Dr Sithembiso Nyoni.

PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has said he is convinced that realising an upper middle-income economy by 2030 is possible as he expressed confidence that new mining investments in Hwange, Matabeleland North Province, will transform the lives of local communities. Speaking during a tour of coal mining companies here yesterday, the President said developmental challenges facing the province and other parts of the country, could easily be solved if private sector players and local communities play ball by partnering with Government in championing development progress. President Mnangagwa, who toured Western Coal and Energy Company, the new South Mining Coke Plant, Jinan/Tutu Coke Project and Hwange Colliery Company’s Chaba Mine, said the new dispensation’s drive was to bring about inclusive growth that is anchored on empowerment of local communities. Traditional leaders were also part of the proceedings. Hwange District alone has seen expansion of mining investments in the last few years with growing focus on diversification towards coal value addition and energy generation, which are set to enhance export prospects and job opportunities. Creating a competitive business environment, expanding the job market and increasing domestic incomes and exports are the hallmark of the Second Republic, said the President. Such a path, he said, could yield the desired economic self-sufficiency that is informed by optimum use of natural resources available in the country. As such, he said yester-year burdens, which have seen places like Hwange and other parts of the country lag behind in terms of development, must be ruthlessly overcome. The President commended the Minister of Mines and Mining Development, Winston Chitando, and his portfolio for boldly pitching a US$12 billion mining target by 2023, as a build up towards towards Vision 2030, saying this drive has to be fully supported with equal enthusiasm by other sectors. “Our desire is to achieve higher middle income by 2030. No doubt, we will achieve the vision we have set but this won’t be achieved by mining alone but all sectors. “I’m happy that in the exploitation of resources in this area, the companies here are doing their best to recruit young people in this area to be given jobs and acquire artisanal skills that are critically important,” said President Mnangagwa. “We must see the change of lives of the local communities because the resource is here. Yes, of course, the country will benefit but we must see also that this area changes and responds to the growth and modernisation of this area. “What is left is for the minister and your people and the companies to deliver what they are telling us.” While Government remains committed to supporting every developmental effort, the President said, private sector support is critical in unlocking wider economic opportunities in respective districts and provinces where companies operate from. “We need those in Government and private sector and communities around to all pull in one direction, in unison,” said President Mnangagwa. “National challenges are not for Government alone but all of us working towards betterment of lives of our people. “Hwange is somewhat behind in terms of infrastructure development. We need no area to be behind.” He called on coal mining companies here to address challenges of water, social amenities like schools and clinics, and road infrastructure as part of their corporate social responsibility. The President said the growing coal mining investments should also assist the country in tackling persistent energy generation shortages, which continue to negatively impact on productive sector. Zimbabwe is currently importing electricity due to a deficit in the local generation of power, yet the country has resources to generate that power. Reliance on imports also drains the economy of scarce forex earnings. On this concern, President Mnangagwa said a roadmap has been set to increase domestic capacity with a view to generating surplus in the short to medium term while also harnessing opportunity around fuel supply and local gas production. Invictus Energy is already exploring prospects for oil in Muzarabani while efforts to tap into vast gas reserves in Lupane are also underway. “We need to access modern technology to convert that gas to our use as well as through the coal processing levels and gas in the country. By 2030 we should be self-sufficient when it comes to fuel. Competencies and skills of doing that are there in the market and we should attract them,” said President Mnangagwa. Despite successive drought seasons that have affected the country due to climate change, President Mnangagwa also bemoaned the fact that Zimbabwe was importing food, stressing the need for adoption of technology and irrigation driven options to utilise the vast tracts of arable land and water bodies to enhance farm production. “We need to produce our own food and feed ourselves. A programme relating to achieving food security is now on course and we have put up a package to support that vision and we believe that within two to three seasons, we should achieve food sufficiency or food security in Zimbabwe. We do not need to import any food at all in Zimbabwe,” he said. “We have adequate electricity and enough fuel in the country. I see no constraint in us achieving what we have set for ourselves; the attainment of higher middle-income status by 2030. All that is needed is focus, stability, harmony and unity in the country and peace. With that we will achieve our goal. We will change the lives of our people. Now can we walk the talk. That is the message throughout.” In his welcome remarks, Matabeleland North Minister for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Richard Moyo expressed appreciation to President Mnangagwa for steering new development projects in the area while making sure that long outstanding ones are completed. He urged investors to consider employing locals while considering environmental issues in their operations. President Mnangagwa and his ministerial delegation comprising Ministers Moyo, Chitando, Dr Sekai Nzenza (Industry and Commerce), Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu (Environment Climate Tourism and Hospitality) continue with the company tours today.

https://www.chronicle.co.zw/binga-gets-26m-devolution-funds/,Binga gets $26m devolution funds,"Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Reporter BINGA Rural District Council has embarked on several capital projects after receiving part of the $26 million under the devolution fund from the Government. In an interview recently, Binga RDC chief executive officer Mr Joshua Muzamba said they have so far received $6 million from the Government and the money was channelled towards rehabilitating roads at Lusulu Business Centre, water and sewer reticulation at Binga Centre and constructing clinics and classroom blocks in several parts of the district. “We have to date received $6 million funding from Government under the devolution grants and we are expecting another $20 million for the district. From the $6 million we got, we roofed classroom blocks at 13 schools whose roofs had been blown away by strong                                                                                            winds and we also managed to build a new classroom block at Chibondo in Manjolo ward,” he said.  The council also procured furniture and other consumables for Chipale Clinic in Sinamagonde ward. “We are also in the process of building two houses for teachers at the same school. We have also built a clinic wing at Malaliya Clinic and erected a perimeter fence and constructed two nurses’ houses. We will do water reticulation and operationalise the clinic in May.” Mr Muzamba said the devolution funds were also used to improve rural service centres in the district.  “We also did water and sewer reticulation at Binga Centre at Govera high density suburb. We also did road rehabilitation at Lusulu Business Centre including other service centres such as Lusulu, Mlibizi, Siabuwa and Manjolo,” he said. “We also did road rehabilitation and created a new road network at Lusulu Business Centre,” he said. Mr Muzamba said the road linking Binga Centre and Siabuwa Road has been rendered inaccessible after Chininga Bridge in Nsungwale area was extensively damaged by floods, which were preceded by heavy rains that lashed the district last month. “The road is generally not trafficable. We are appealing to the Government to upgrade it because as a local authority we only do feeder roads but for the economic movement of goods and services we will need trunk roads to be established,” he said. The council set aside a budget of $62 million for 2020, but in terms of developmental projects, the district is lagging behind especially in social infrastructure like schools and clinics. Mr Muzamba said the remaining $20 million under the devolution grant will go towards construction of more schools and clinics. “We will also do water reticulation for Manjolo because we anticipate it to grow especially when Binga Centre is turned into a local board as we are moving in that direction. So, we have to provide water services for commercial purposes. We are therefore working on ensuring that we have the required infrastructure like water and sewer reticulation,” he said. “We think in a year or two we should be having Binga Centre turned into a local board on its own. We are hopeful that in the next two years, we should have put up a sound refuse collection system, an adequate water and reticulation system.” According to the 2012 census, Binga Centre has a population of 10 000 people. The district has a total of 18 health institutions in its 25 wards. Mr Muzamba also expressed concern over the human-wildlife conflict, which he attributed to the growing populations. “We are having human settlements encroaching into formerly designated wildlife areas resulting in elephants, hippos and buffaloes straying into the fields of surrounding communities. We also witnessing an increase in attacks by crocodiles especially on the fishermen and we have reaction teams from council assisted by ZimParks and Forestry Commission,” he said. – @mashnets "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-adopts-new-agric-recovery-strategy/,Zimbabwe adopts new agric recovery strategy,"Business Reporter GOVERNMENT has adopted a new conservation agriculture model called, Pfumvudza/Intwasa, that seeks to increase household food security across provinces through commercialising small holder farming. Developing robust agriculture value chains and channelling adequate support to specialised farming segments are at the heart of the model, which is expected to assist the country to trim the food import bill.  The model involves holing out and mulching on farms to boost output in light of the continued reduction in crop production. Like most countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region and beyond, Zimbabwe has not been spared from the adverse effects of climate change that have caused output in the agriculture sector to decline. Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister, Perence Shiri, said conservation agriculture modelling was being introduced against a background of continued decline in maize, wheat and soya bean output, which is a threat to national food security. As a result of declining agricultural output, Zimbabwe is spending millions on food imports. “This is against a backdrop of foreign currency shortages and increased global commodity prices. The recovery plan seeks to reverse the negative production trends, attain self-sufficiency and allow the country to move away from perpetual importation of these strategic commodities,” said Minister Shiri in a statement. “Achieving this enables the agriculture sector to occupy its rightful position in steering the country towards attainment of Vision 2030.” Official data shows that drought conditions saw the country’s harvest fall by about 53 percent year-on-year in 2018/19 production season to 800 000 tonnes when compared to 1,8 million tonnes of maize required per year. In the 2020 national budget statement, Treasury indicated that at least 3,7 million were in need of humanitarian food assistance between July 2019  to April 2020. This year’s rainy season has also not been favourable with southern parts of the country, mainly Matabeleland provinces, counting losses of crop failure due to erratic rains. Outside maize, Zimbabwe on average spends US$100 million importing wheat, US$200 million on crude soya oil and about US$100 million on fertiliser products. On average cereals alone gobble about US$500 million. As such, Minister Shiri said the recovery plan was premised on key elements that include Climate Proofed-Presidential Input Support Scheme, financial services sector-led commercial contract farming and the commodity value chain financing model. The Climate Proofed-Presidential Input Support Scheme aims to support 1,6 million vulnerable households to produce maize with standardised input package of 5 kilogramme seed, 50kg basal and 50kg top dressing fertiliser. Minister Shiri said 32kg of basal and top dressing fertiliser can establish two standardised 0,06 hactare-plot each and the two plots can produce over 1 600kg up to 3 200kg of maize grain, enough to feed an average household of five people, leaving surplus. The other plot, he said, would produce surplus for sale and the model intends to address household food security as well as commercialisation of smallholder farming in Zimbabwe. “The farming method adopted on the plots will be the conservation agriculture (Pfumvudza/Intwasa concept, which involves holing out and mulching) and will be standardised throughout the country,” said the minister. “This requires a well capacitated extension system with potential to transform the smallholder sector to produce the country’s food requirements. “This will allow the large farmers to focus on export crops production while 8 500 rural schools will be used as centres of excellence and community centres used to disseminate information on the Pfumvudza concept,” he said. However, Minister Shiri said the programme requires a robust and a well-capacitated extension provision system for technical backstopping, tracking and monitoring. In this light, it is hoped that each extension worker will be required to establish at least a one demonstration plot and given targets to train, track and monitor the adoption of conservation agriculture on 350 households. The demonstration plots will also be established at schools for teaching students as well as used as centres of excellence. “For a farmer to become a beneficiary, all the necessary preparatory activities such as holing out, mulching harvesting by August, should form the criteria.  “Each household is expected to deliver at least 100kg of maize grain as contribution to the Strategic Grain Reserve. The 100kg contribution should unlock package for the next season,” he said. "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/us1-billion-2023-target-set-for-diamond-sector/,US$1 billion 2023 target set for diamond sector,"Pride Mahlangu, Business Reporter MINES and Mining Development Minister, Winston Chitando, says the diamond industry is projected to contribute US$1 billion towards of the targeted US$12 billion mining revenues annually by 2023. Last October, President Mnangagwa launched a strategic roadmap to the achievement of a US$12 billion mining industry by 2023, as Government ramps up efforts to increase the sector’s contribution to the economy by facilitating the exploitation of minerals throughout the entire value chain, with certain targets per mineral. Updating parliament on Wednesday about mining progress, Minister Winston Chitando said the US$12 billion milestone was based on detailed projections and targets. He said US$165 million was realised from the diamond sector in 2019 compared to US$98 million in 2018. As such, the minister said interventions were being put in place to ensure the diamond industry increases output starting this year moving towards achievement of the US$1 billion mark by 2023. “Diamonds are expected to contribute US$1 billion towards the US$12 billion target for the mining industry by 2023,” said Chitando.  “In line with diamond policy, Anjin Investments has started production and Alrosa Diamonds, which is the largest producer of diamonds in the world and is already on the ground evaluating several sites to commence production. Government is working on improvements of the marketing framework.” The minister said the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) was also expected to gradually increase production. On the platinum industry, Minister Chitando said the sector was expected to contribute US$3 billion towards the US$12 billion target by 2023 centred on the expansion and production of projects undertaken by Unki, Zimplats Holdings Limited (Zimplats) and Mimosa Platinum mines.  “Great Dyke investments have started opening a mining area and it is scheduled to produce its first concentrate in 2021. Karo Resources are ready to commence project work on the 1st portal having undertaken extensive evaluation work,” he said.  “Bravura is on the ground undertaking evaluation work. Discussions with Todal Mining Ltd are advanced for them to get into the project phase; actually, they had a board meeting sometime this week.” Minister Chitando said the chrome, nickel and steel sector were earmarked to achieve US$1 billion by 2023, and that the achievement will be necessitated by increased production due to various expansion projects underway by Zimasco, Zim-Alloys, JINAN and AFROSHEEN and a few other players. Recently, Government said mining sector regulations were expected to contribute US$4 billion to the economy this year due to fresh capital injection on new and existing projects. — @pridesinstinctz "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/president-commissions-us15m-irrigation-project/,President commissions US$15m irrigation project,"Samuel Kadungure, Harare Bureau PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday had a hectic programme in Nyanga that saw him officially commission Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme in the morning before addressing a rally at Bumhira Secondary School in the afternoon. The project, which started in 2015, was funded to the tune of US$15 million under the Japanese Grant Aid. The department of irrigation under the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), were involved in the rehabilitation and development of the facility. Nyakomba Phase 2 expansion project included construction of new pumping facilities, improving water level control, distribution and flow measurement. New canal structures were built, while the existing ones were modified. An overnight storage pond was also built while pumps and flood protection structures for Blocks B, C and D pump stations that were damaged by floods in 2006 were also repaired and replaced. New irrigation infrastructure was installed on Block A, which has 146ha.  President Mnangagwa said Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme was one of the most critical irrigation schemes in the country whose modernisation would increase productivity following the rehabilitation and expansion works.   “We came here at the invitation of members of Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme. Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister Perrance Shiri once invited us but we could not make it because of other commitments but this time we have managed to,” said the President while addressing a rally at Bumhira Secondary School later in the day. Cde Mnangagwa said he had come to Nyakomba specifically to see their work that was targeted to sustain livelihoods.  “When we toured the project, we saw men and women The project is targeting export markets, so I had to see where they produce and process it. They export it to America, where they are paid in US dollars,” he explained. The President revealed that the farmers had told him that they earn in excess of US$1 000 from produce grown on their 0, 2 hectare pieces of land but they also produce other crops such as maize and cotton under irrigation supported by the Japanese government. Government, added Cde Mnangagwa, would in the next three years, prioritise construction of dams and drilling of boreholes with a view to put 100 000 hectares under irrigation. This initiative will be implemented in all districts in the country. Meanwhile, President Mnangagwa also took the war on coronavirus to the gathering, where he reiterated that Government was taking all necessary precautions against the coronavirus.  “There is an outbreak of the coronavirus disease worldwide, which has seen only a few countries from the African continent remain unaffected. Thousands of people have died, while many others are sick so we have taken measures as a country so that if we record a positive case we will be ready to deal with it. We thank our God that we have not recorded any case of the virus up to now that I might know.  “We were supposed to host the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in April but this disease does not want people to congregate because if one of them is infected, he or she can pass it on to all those that he or she comes into contact with,” he said.  And since ZITF attracts a lot of people, which increases the chances of the disease spreading, Government has seen it fit to move it to a later date other than in April so it will be hosted once the disease is confirmed over, said the President. He also added that the independence celebrations that had been slated for Bulawayo had been shelved. President Mnangagwa said he had deliberately set March 20 as the date on which his directive for people to avoid gatherings in excess of 100 would come into effect because of yesterday’s event. “The ban will come into force on Friday (tomorrow) so people can still congregate up to Thursday (today) and not breach the ban hence you have the permission to gather as you have done here today,” said the President. He took the opportunity to advise people that schools would remain open till the end of the term. He said Government would also distribute the new batch of Zupco buses to provinces to ease transport problems in rural areas. President Mnangagwa promised to repair all damaged roads and bridges in Chimanimani and Nyanga districts, adding that 33 new buses would be given to civil servants.  The President also warned party supporters against the imposition of candidates during the ongoing restructuring exercises. Cde Mnangagwa later donated laptops (10 per school) to Avilla Secondary School, Regina Coeil Secondary, Nyakomba Secondary, Chatindo Secondary, Bumhura Secondary Schools (all Nyanga), Dewedzo (Makoni), Stirkroem (Chipinge), St David’s Bonda (Mutasa) and Chikuvire Primary School for use under the e-learning initiative. Schools from Nyanga received 1 000 exercise books and sporting kits. The President also donated 90 tonnes of rice to Nyanga South and Nyanga North constituencies. "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/matabeleland-south-trims-winter-wheat-hectarage/,Matabeleland South trims winter wheat hectarage,"Sikhulekelani Moyo, [email protected] DECLINING water levels in major dams in Matabeleland South province has forced farmers to reduce the land area to be planted under the 2024 winter wheat to 3  700 hectares against a target of 5 500 hectares. Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Deputy Minister, Davis Marapira visited the province on Thursday and met farmers at Esigodini Agriculture College who raised concern over the depleting water levels following poor inflows this season due to El-Nino induced drought. Following a tour of winter wheat projects in Matabeleland South and Midlands provinces, Deputy Minister Marapira said the declining water levels would slightly strain the harvest as farmers have to trim the hectarage. Zimbabwe is one of the hardest hit countries in the region and President Mnangagwa has since declared this year’s drought a State of disaster. The country is now pinning its hopes on salvaging yields from crops under irrigation and the winter wheat. Government and private sector players have pumped in significant resources to ensure successful winter wheat production. The target is to plant 120 000 hectares this winter which is expected to give the country 600 000 tonnes of wheat which is well above the 468 000 tonnes produced from 91 000ha last year.   This would be 240 000 tonnes above the minimum of 360 000 tonnes needed for self-sufficiency.  Deputy Minister Marapira said due to the effects of El Nino, farmers used a lot of water during the summer cropping, which has resulted in the decline in water levels. “We are here in Matabeleland South to check on the winter wheat production for the 2024 season. The target for the province was 5 500 ha. Unfortunately farmers used a lot of water during the summer cropping season and as a result some dams do not have enough water to irrigate winter wheat,” he said. Deputy Minister Marapira said some farmers will , not be able to plant this winter while those with water can only plant 3 700ha. “We may have challenges like late input supply hence my ministry is engaging Treasury to make sure that all inputs are paid for and delivered within a reasonable time. Our banks are signing contracts late, which also may affect our winter wheat planting,” he said. Deputy Minister Marapira urged farmers to work harder and ensure winter wheat planting is completed by the end of this month. He also encouraged all stakeholders who are part of the winter wheat production to be active on the ground to make sure that inputs are ready and that there is electricity throughout. During the meeting it emerged that Matabeleland South has so far planted about 500 hectares of wheat. Speaking at the same event, one of the farmers from Matabeleland South Mr Clarkson Matshiya said the shortage of water due to El Nino was negatively affecting a lot of agriculture activities in the province. He said what made the situation worse for the province was that its major dams were supplying water to Bulawayo. Mr Matshiya however, said he hoped the completion of the Lake Gwayi-Shangani project, which is part of the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project will bring a lot of relief to both farmers and Bulawayo residents. The massive water project is expected to ease pressure on Matabeleland South dams such as Mtshabezi, Umzingwane, which are situated in communal areas and support irrigation and livestock projects. Other farmers also called upon the Government to fast track the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme saying this will also assist in improving water supply. – @SikhulekelaniM1.      "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/czi-makes-zig-conversion-proposals/,CZI makes ZiG conversion proposals,"Business Writer BUSINESSES will face severe working capital challenges if the central bank insists on converting outstanding auction allotments into a two-year ZiG denominated non-negotiable certificates of deposit (NNCDs). According to the 2024 Monetary Policy Statement presented by new RBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu, following the establishment of a refined interbank foreign exchange market, all outstanding auction allotments will be converted into ZiG and refunded to recipients at the current interbank exchange rate. The refund will entail the conversion of all outstanding auction allotments into a two-year ZiG-denominated instrument at an interest rate of 7,5 percent per annum. Further, all outstanding payments for foreign exchange purchased by Treasury under the 25 percent surrender requirement will be converted to a ZiG-denominated instrument with a tenor of one year at an interest rate of 7,5 percent per annum. Dr Mushayavanhu justified the conversion and said it “will allow the new system to start on a clean slate using the interbank foreign exchange system”. However, the business community is of the view that, the proposed issuance of two-year non-negotiable certificates of deposits for these obligations means that companies will in principle be deprived of desperately needed working capital for that period, holding back production. A player in the pharmaceutical industry, who requested not to be named, said “the impact is severe for small players because the money is supposed to buy stocks”. “So if you can’t buy stocks then you are out of business. What this means is that many will be forced to borrow if they are to survive,” said the pharmacists. The official also expressed concern on the 7,5 percent interest rate that is being offered which he feared will be eroded by inflation. Economic analyst and Founder & Executive Officer at SME Association of Zimbabwe, Farai Mutambanengwe said the conversion is disruptive to business. “Most of that money is working capital which means it was supposed to buy raw materials now but is being converted to a two-year treasury bill, obviously that’s very disruptive to business,” he said. Busisa Moyo, chairman for the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA) shared the same sentiment and said “the impact will be quite severe because it means that those companies no longer have access to working capital”. “Some of them are already sitting on legacy debt from 2018,” said Moyo. Business lobby group, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) believes the conversion of the outstanding auction bids to NNCDs is an immediate extraction of about US$90 million dollars’ worth of working capital from the manufacturing sector. “The constraint on productive capacity is immense considering the absence and at best high cost of working capital in the market,” said CZI in an NNCD discussion paper seen by this publication. The companies have already sustained significant opportunity costs with the money tied up in unsettled auctions. It will be unfair to load them with additional costs especially given that many other companies have had their auction obligations settled in full via pre-funding arrangements.”  The business grouping said instead of converting the overdue auction allotments, there are alternative ways that will enable companies to mobilise funds without having any impact on ZiG trading. “We believe that these proposals have no downside risk for Treasury. Indeed Treasury will benefit from increased taxes on the production boost that will result from the proposals,” said CZI. The Business Member Organisation (BMO) proposed a set of alternatives to address the issue of outstanding business payments that the central bank want to convert to non-negotiable certificates of deposit (NNCDs). The CZI argues that these alternatives will lead to a faster recovery for affected companies compared to relying solely on NNCDs. According to the CZI, their proposed solutions would avoid negatively impacting the Zimbabwean dollar (ZiG) trading while stimulating the economy by enabling affected businesses to return to full production quickly. Issuing US dollar treasury bills as suggested in one option, would demonstrate the Government’s commitment to upholding the value of the ZiG. This approach is seen as a fairer solution to companies experiencing delays and significant opportunity costs due to unsettled auctions. By settling in USD, the Government would signal confidence in the stability of the ZiG compared to the current practice that some view as expressing a lack of confidence. Another option proposes allowing companies holding NNCDs to use them for settling statutory obligations like taxes owed to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) or electricity bills owed to the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa). This would essentially allow businesses to indirectly offset their debts with the Government, potentially preventing market disruptions upon settlement. Recognising that the blocked USD balances were meant for importing critical supplies, the CZI also proposes converting NNCDs into 360-day letters of credit. This would involve collaborating with one or two local banks to establish a system that grants immediate access to essential raw materials for affected companies. The CZI emphasises that many companies have already had their auction obligations fully settled through pre-funding arrangements. They argue that using NNCDs exclusively would unfairly burden businesses that were not part of those arrangements. By advocating for these alternative solutions, the CZI aims to accelerate economic recovery through a swifter return to full production for Zimbabwean businesses. – Business Weekly    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/vfex-launches-cfds/,VFEX launches CFDs,"Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE Contract for Differences (CFDs) launched by Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube here on Friday marks the operationalisation of the Offshore Financial Services Centre, which would be a catalyst for foreign direct investment. Prof Ncube launched the contract for differences (CFD) at the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX), thereby positioning Zimbabwe as a regional financial hub and attracting both domestic and international investors. Vision Capital Group (VCG) is pioneering the CFD product in partnership with VFEX, which was launched in October 2020 to kick-start the Offshore Financial Services Centre (OFSC) earmarked for the Special Economic Zone SEZ) in Victoria Falls as the Government designated the city as an international financial services centre in the last leg of reforms to make the SEZ attractive to investors. The move is part of efforts to attract global capital and restore foreign investor confidence in Zimbabwe’s capital markets while helping companies raise capital in foreign currency. A CFD is a financial contract that pays the differences in the settlement price between the open and closing trades. CFDs essentially allow investors to trade the direction of securities over the very short-term. They enhance protection of investors’ money given the background of loss of savings in the past as they offer a unique opportunity rather than owning the underlying asset. Market participants buy or sell units to trade based on a particular financial instrument’s underlying price depending on whether they believe its value will go up or down.  Speaking at the launch Prof Ncube said VFEX was strategically placed as a global competitive platform for the trading of stocks in hard currency.  “It gives me great pleasure to be here with you today as we launch a new product on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange, the Contract for Difference. “The birth of VFEX in 2020 was one of the many initiatives implemented by the Government of Zimbabwe to stabilise our economy and attract foreign direct investment,” he said.  “Today, we stand here celebrating the continued growth of VFEX, not only in terms of new listings but also addition of new products. The launch of CFDs on VFEX speaks to the focus of National Development Strategy 1 as this product will deepen financial inclusion and will significantly aid in promoting financial inclusion and literacy. “The trading of CFDS on the VFEX marks a significant milestone in the evolution of our capital markets and reaffirms Zimbabwe’s commitment to fostering innovation and progress in consolidating economic transformation as reiterated in the 2024 national budget,” said Prof Ncube.  He said the introduction of the CFDs trading on the VFEX represents a positive step as it provides investors with versatile and dynamic tools to participate in the financial markets through regulated instruments. The launch of CFDs will enable investors to trade CFDs on a regulated platform and also increase retail participation and aid in financial inclusion. Minister Ncube said investors can gain access to various assets including equities, indices, commodities and currencies without the need for ownership of the underlying asset itself. He said Government has been working tirelessly to revitalise domestic and foreign investments, which are critical to growing the economy. Capital markets complement policy initiatives and become the transmission mechanisms through which Government can gauge the vitality of its policies.  Prof Ncube said the launch of CFDs has come at an opportune time given the rapidly changing global finance landscape as it has become crucial for investors to have access to innovative instruments that can assist them in managing their risk and seize opportunities in volatile markets.  He said the CFDs’ introduction aligns with the broader vision of positioning Zimbabwe as a regional financial hub and attracting both domestic and international investors. VCG Markets chief executive Mr Abdallah Garib said they were committed to complementing Government saying investments in technology are paving the way for a new era in international collaboration thereby enabling the African markets to tap into the global market and positioning Africa’s ecosystem as the gateway to unlocking the expansion of investments.    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-smallholder-farmers-need-technologies-access-to-spur-production/,Zimbabwe smallholder farmers need technologies access to spur production,"THERE is a need to assist smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe to access technologies that will enable them to increase farm yields, achieve resilience, better nutrition to address poverty and food security as well as economic growth, a Cabinet Minister has said. Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister Dr Anxious Masuka said this at a symposium on Combating Food Insecurity in Southern Africa in the Era of Climate Change Through Mitigation and Adaptation Measures, which his Ministry held jointly with the Bindura University of Science Education in the capital last week. In a speech, which Ministry permanent secretary Professor Obert Jiri read on his behalf, Dr Masuka said there is need for a paradigm shift that enables smallholder farmers in the country, particularly in rural areas, to produce enough to feed themselves and to sell. He said such technologies are simple conventional ones including irrigation, improved seed varieties, use of fertilisers and provision of infrastructure, which have been tested elsewhere.  Dr Masuka said the era when large multinational organisations were considered the only solution to successful agricultural production in the developing world, Southern Africa included, has passed. “The region’s agriculture has continued to under-perform because it is not giving farmers enough yield to feed themselves and get more to take to the market,” he told representatives of government and parastatal officials, academics and educators, researchers, scientists, farmer organisations Non-Governmental organisations, development agencies, business leaders, entrepreneurs, students and young professionals. We are talking about when the rain does not come at the right time or the length of the (growing) season is shortened as a result of drought,” he told the high-level two-day symposium, which ended on Thursday. He added that assisting small-scale farmers to adopt “climate-smart” farming techniques will “prepare them for even more serious challenges in the future”. “An important factor of good land management is the effective and efficient use of water — groundwater, surface water and rainwater,” he said. “When we talk about smallholding farming in Zimbabwe we are talking about a system in which most people depend on rainfall. Therefore, to build a climate-smart system, we need to find a way to preserve the water via rainwater harvesting, among other technologies. What we need to help farmers do is to be able to adopt good land management practices and improve seed stocks, with drought-resistant varieties.” Dr Masuka warned: “Whether we like it or not, climate change is a phenomenon the region is facing. The worst effects of climate change are yet to come, we already have many technologies available to face them and protect our future food supply.” Speaking at the same occasion, Eddie Mwenje, vice-chancellor of the Bindura University of Science Education said a failed season poses a real threat to food security in Zimbabwe.  – New Ziana.logies   "

Speaking in Daluka ward 19 in Lupane East during a Constituency School Business Unit Groundbreaking ceremony, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Professor Ober Jiri
stressed the importance of villagers closely working with extension officers. Prof Jiri said extension officers play a pivotal role in reducing drought impact through advising farmers on best practices in the process ensuring food security. He said all hands should be on deck to migrate the effects of El Nino induce drought countrywide. President Mnangagwa has since declared a nationwide State of Disaster due to the severe drought caused by the El Niño weather phenomenon. “This year we are faced with serious drought. As Government, we said let us monitor weather patterns and ensure what is cultivated should be in line with weather patterns of particular regions. “For this region (Matabeleland North) we encourage small grains and our observations is that farmers and ordinary villagers are implementing that through adhering to extension officer’s advice,” said Prof Jiri. “As Government we applaud the work done by extension officers, it is commendable, ” he added. Prof Jiri said despite the effects of drought many people had prepared for El Nino and President Mnangagwa has declared a state of disaster but stressed that no one will die of hunger. “Food relief will be distributed countrywide through the Social Department. As the ministry, we should plan ahead to prevent falling victim to future droughts.” He emphasised the importance of implementing Intwasa initiative. Prof Jiri also touched on the importance of proper livestock care saying farmers should adhere to dipping regime. “We should reduce livestock deaths. Therefore, due to water shortages, borehole drilling rigs should be deployed in needy areas so that livestock have access to water. “Also, we are against veld fires, that should not happen.

She said the access to information about communicable and non-communicable diseases could help eliminate wrong beliefs about some of the diseases afflicting the continent.  Dr Ndlovu made the remarks at the ongoing 5th edition of Africa Women Summit in Nairobi, Kenya. She is among Zimbabwean delegates who include the Minister of State for Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Cde Judith Ncube, and the Permanent Secretary for Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Dr Mavis Sibanda. The Summit is running under the theme: “Women’s Health, Empowering Voices, Inspiring Change”, which end today with a focus on bringing together influential leaders, advocates, experts and stakeholders across the globe to address critical issues surrounding women’s health.  “Empowering women to speak out about their health concerns also can inspire change and help reduce stigma. Empowered women would be less vulnerable to abuse,” said Dr Ndlovu. “We have to create women entrepreneurs who can be independent and think through empowerment tools that can be used to prevent violence against women.  “We must always aspire to change our ways and habits to prevent us from catching communicable and non-communicable diseases for the good of our children and our nations.” The minister said Africa cannot bear the burden of high health expenditures on treatment of various diseases that torment citizens, stressing the need to prevent illnesses. “We must also inspire change in our habits and in the food that we consume, so that we prevent catching various non communicable diseases. We have to continually engage in physical exercises to keep our bodies fit,” she said. Dr Ndlovu said there is a need for there is a strong need to establish a strong rapport in the continent to ensure that the message of women empowerment is heard.  She also urged women not to shy away from discussing sexual health issues with their families or even among themselves. “We must continue to educate them on their rights. The right to say no and the right to say yes. And the reason why they should say no or yes. Knowing their rights is a preventive measure against abuse and getting into unplanned relationships,” said Dr Ndlovu. “It’s, therefore, important to have a rural health care facility in every village ward, which is well stocked with medicines and medical equipment. I would also like to talk about Gender Based Violence. Especially in relation to prevention and support mechanisms. Very often those abused fail to get the necessary support.” She challenged the conference delegates to discuss strategies and mechanisms of counselling those who have been abused and condemned incidents of gender-based violence, calling for more empowerment initiatives as a long term strategy to full emancipation of women.     "

Fueltec is a petrochemical company which focuses on the petroleum industry. The company covers every stage of the fuel supply chain from bulk fuel handling, retail, commercial and individual operators. In an interview, Fueltec sales and marketing manager Mr John Kaitano told the Business Chronicle that since the opening of their Bulawayo branch, they have managed to get many contracts from large established companies to maintain their pumps and other fuel handling machines. He commended their technician covering the southern region for doing a sterling job “Fueltec is growing. The company opened its Bulawayo brunch in 2022 and up to now we have seen growth of about 10 percent,” he said. “We have a new contract with Puma to maintain their pumps across the country and we have staff that will be servicing the region covering Hwange, Kwekwe and Beitbridge. “We are also working with Hwange, Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), and the Beitbridge- Bulawayo Railway (BBR) maintaining of their locos.” Mr Kaitano said plans are underway to install some K200 meters on the locomotives so that they are able to manage the fuel consumption of locos. Meanwhile, the company is embracing new ways of fuel handling Mr Kaitano said they are introducing a fuel dispenser with four pumps and above, which uses a submersible pump. He also said they have introduced TLS, which is a computer system which is used to monitor the movement of fuel from the tanks. “When you receive a new fuel consignment, this TLS, which is a fuel management system will show you new fuel levels and as you issue out, selling to your customers, it will also show you the levels at any given time. “It also gives you some reports depending on what you want to know about your fuel level and it avoids the manual dipping, which promotes efficiency and reduces human error,” he said. “We are also bringing the new product which is called Razm to manage your oils which will avoid oil spilling promoting proper oil handling and disposing of used oils.” @SikhulekelaniM1 "

https://www.chronicle.co.zw/eca-calls-for-human-rights-and-people-centered-approach-to-sustainable-development-in-africa/,ECA calls for human rights and people-centered approach to sustainable development in Africa,"Leonard Ncube, [email protected] The Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has urged for a human-rights and people-centered approach to sustainable development in Africa which is key in ensuring that no one is left behind ECA, established by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1958 as one of the UN’s regional commissions, aims to promote economic and social development among its member states, including Zimbabwe. Its mission includes fostering intraregional integration and enhancing international cooperation for Africa’s development. With 54 Member States, ECA serves as both a regional branch of the UN and a crucial element of Africa’s institutional framework. Speaking at the 57th Session of the Commission on Population and Development in New York City, M Sweta Saxena, Director of the Gender, Poverty, and Social Policy Division at ECA, highlighted that Africa has effectively communicated its priorities by embracing a unified stance on Population and Development in 2022. This approach considers shared interests, differences, and obstacles. “A human rights and people-centric approach to sustainable development in Africa is key to ensuring that no one is left behind and this means that women, young people and vulnerable groups must receive priority attention,” said Ms Saxena. Zimbabwe has already taken the lead in that approach through President Mnangagwa and his Second Republic’s Leaving no-one and no place behind mantra. The meeting was held under the theme: “Assessing the status of implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and its contribution to the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development during the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development”. Ms Saxena highlighted three key issues where regional commitment is vital. She said Africa needs to respond to its population dynamics, which include rapid population growth in countries with some of the most fragile health systems, high rates of poverty, low literacy, high levels of gender inequality and limited access to modern technologies. These dynamics must be accounted for in the design and implementation of  development plans, as well as their implications for Africa’s structural transformation. Secondly, to sustain the successes of the past 30 years, governments need to tackle the inequalities that hurt the poorest and the most marginalized by implementing policies and allocating budgets to ensure the poor and the marginalized benefit from economic growth. Africa also needs to invest in the production of high-quality statistical information and data. In many countries, data systems remain poor – civil registration data are limited and surveys and censuses are not conducted on a regular basis. “A data revolution in Africa would afford our continent to generate its own vibrant data to enable proper planning and better measurement of development outcomes, including the goals and objectives on population and development,” she said. To support Africa’s transformation, ECA in partnership with UNFPA and the African Union has this year carried out a high-quality and evidence-based continental review of the implementation of the AADPD since 2014. Its aim is to influence national policies on population and development. Two decades after the historic Cairo population conference, Africa adopted the Addis Ababa Declaration on Population and Development beyond 2014 which provides region-specific guidance for the full implementation of ICPD in Africa. -@ncubeleon   "

The council is authorized under Sections 48 and 49 of the Model Buildings By-Laws, 1977, as well as Section 214 of the Bulawayo (Buildings, roads and Streets) By-Laws 1971, to address unsafe and unsightly buildings and faulty sewerage systems by charging the property owner for the necessary actions to safeguard public safety. Out of 161 identified buildings in the CBD, 17 have complied, 61 partially complied, four faced legal action, and 79 have made no effort to address structural issues, resulting in penalties being imposed on non-compliant properties. Penalties range from US$500 for buildings without plans and US$250 for building penalties (with plans) and dilapidated buildings The council in its latest report acknowledges that certain buildings in the city center were deteriorating, some abandoned or in a state of disrepair, necessitating action to mitigate risks to the public, though resource constraints have hindered the effective implementation of these measures. Reads part of the report, “Buildings in the city centre were in a poor state and some were considered abandoned, dilapidated or derelict were identified. Council had latitude in terms of statutory provisions to carry out such operations to remove the offending danger/ nuisance to the public at the cost of the landlord. “This avenue had not been effectively pursued in the city in view of lack of specific resources that were required to undertake this costly work that is clearing the sites and effecting demolitions and making good the site.” Chamber Secretary Mrs Sikhangele Zhou highlighted the challenges faced by the council in addressing dilapidated buildings, citing the council’s own struggles with maintenance, particularly with buildings such as  Sidojiwe and Burombo Flats, due to limited resources available for refurbishment efforts “It was a challenge to effect these as Council’s own buildings were also dilapidated. Residents always complained about flats such as Sidojiwe and Burombo Flats. Council did not afford to revamp dilapidated buildings as it was already struggling to refurbish its own premises (buildings and halls),” she said.       "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/bulawayo-out-to-lure-belarus-investors/,Bulawayo out to lure Belarus investors,"Michelle Moyo, [email protected] BULAWAYO Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Judith Ncube will lead a delegation to showcase the city’s investment potential in Belarus later this month. Minister Ncube and senior Bulawayo City Council (BCC) officials will tour the Eastern European country from May 24 to June 1 under the Black Horse Alley LLC Trade and Commerce umbrella. Since the advent of the Second Republic, Zimbabwe and Belarus have strengthened their co-operation, focusing on economic diplomacy and exchanges in key sectors for economic growth and transformation. The two countries are enhancing collaboration in areas such as mining, infrastructure development and science and innovation. Trade between Belarus and Zimbabwe has grown significantly since 2018, with both nations working on long-term investment projects in agriculture, light industry, mining, healthcare and industrial co-operation. The Belarus Mechanisation Facility has completed two phases, delivering over 2,000 units of various Belarusian agricultural machinery.  With close national bonds, Bulawayo aims to leverage these ties to explore potential areas of co-operation with Belarus According to the latest council minutes, Minister Ncube wrote to the local authority notifying them about the invitation. “My office, the Office of the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Bulawayo Metropolitan Province has been invited to visit the Republic of Belarus under the Black Horse Alley LLC Trade and Commerce umbrella, from the 24th of May to 1 of June 2024. It is against this background that I hereby invite the Town Clerk and Director of Health Services to be part of the delegation that will represent Bulawayo Province on this official visit to the Republic of Belarus. All travelling costs will be borne by the participants,” wrote Minister Ncube. Bulawayo City Council (BCC) The main purpose of the visit is to explore areas of possible co-operation through formal meetings with the National Agency of Investment and Privatisation of the Republic of Belarus and a wide sector of industries for commercial Trade and Joint implementation opportunities. Added to that, site visits and inspections with enterprises in the fields of pharmaceutical medicines, animal health products, agricultural mechanisation equipment and technologies are lined up. Town Clerk, Mr Christopher Dube told councillors that it is critical for the council to have representation as the platform was a valuable opportunity that would economically benefit the city and would help solidify the trade relationship with Belarus through promoting the importation and distribution of Belarusian products in Bulawayo. The council resolved to have Mr Dube and the Director of Health Services, Dr Edwin Sibanda Mzingwane, as representatives of the city. Late last year, Minister Ncube led a city business delegation to the 26th Arab-African Investment and International Co-operation Conference in Egypt to attract international investors to the city. The transformation of Bulawayo’s economy is crucial for the overall development of Zimbabwe as outlined in the National Development Strategy 1 (2021-2025), which aims to progress towards achieving an upper middle-income economy by 2030. The Bulawayo Metropolitan Provincial Economic Development Plan (PEDP) is based on the national development blueprint and aims to leverage key comparative advantages that position the city for significant investment opportunities, particularly in manufacturing-related sectors. Formerly a thriving industrial hub of Zimbabwe with robust infrastructure in industries like textile, leather, meat processing, pharmaceuticals and cement products, among others, Bulawayo is now focused on reviving its past prosperity. In collaboration with the Government in the Second Republic, the city is seizing every opportunity to establish itself as the premier investment and industrial centre, emphasising expanding production, creating more job opportunities and increasing export revenues.       "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/government-committed-to-reviving-byo-industries/,Government committed to reviving Bulawayo industries,"Peter Matika, [email protected] GOVERNMENT has re-iterated its commitment to support the revival of Bulawayo industries through continued implementation of sustainable ease of doing business reforms and initiatives that promote increased production capacity and export competitiveness. Special Advisor to the President Responsible for Monitoring and Implementation of Government Programmes, Dr Joram Gumbo, who was in Bulawayo yesterday on a tour of General Beltings (GB) Holdings Limited, one of the giant city companies, said the Government through the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has crafted strategies targeted at the revival of ailing industries.  GB Holdings gained prominence for the production of conveyor belts during the pre and post-independence period.  “Its operations were, however, affected by the closure of industries because of various reasons, including the sanctions induced economic hardships,” said Dr Gumbo. The conveyor belt manufacturing company requires at least US$22 million capitalisation funding to modernise its plants and hopes to secure a loan from the Matabeleland Industries Retooling Facility.  Dr Gumbo said some of the measures to support local industries include the promulgation of Statutory Instrument 126 of 2014, which prohibits the importation of locally available rubber products under the Open General Import Licence, the setting up of a Distressed Industries Marginalised Areas Fund (Dimaf) and the Matabeleland Industries Retooling Loan Facility to financially assist distressed companies. He said the purpose of his engagement with industry captains is to expedite project implementation for the accelerated attainment of Vision 2030. “I have had the honour to monitor some development projects covering different sectors, especially those focused on the resuscitation of industries in this previously renowned industrial hub,” said Dr Gumpo. “Government is looking to have a private sector led economy, which will lay the foundation for the achievement of Vision 2030.  “I would like to assure you that the Government will continue to provide an environment that is conducive for private sector led businesses to flourish,” Dr Gumbo said. He said the global industry trends and patterns show that innovation and modernisation are critical if companies are to remain competitive. “I am informed that GB Holdings requires funding to the tune of US$22million in order to modernize its plants among other endeavours,” said Dr Gumbo.  “It is our expectation that the application will be successful and thereby pave way for a serious implementation of the retooling programme.” He said Government’s intention to strengthen the approach to industry operations would ensure that local entities do not lose market share, which might result in closure of business. “My visit comes at a time when there is a profound decrease in manufacturing in the local market share for GB Holdings. I have been briefed that GB Holdings has been confronted with numerous challenges despite the establishment, resuscitation and expansion of mines across the country, which would ordinarily require belts,” said the minister.  “The challenges include stiff competition from cheap imports and limited access to foreign currency to import raw materials.” He said controlling cheap imports was critical to protect local firms and job retention while growing the economy.  “We, therefore, need to find sustainable strategies and initiatives of supporting our own local industries,” said Dr Gumbo. “Indeed, only Zimbabweans can unlock growth, unleash potential and employment opportunities for our population.” GB Holdings acting group managing director, Mr Joseph Gunda, said despite playing a key role in the economy, the company was facing a number of challenges that are crippling operations, such as smuggling and importation of cheap conveyor belts. “The company is a key player in reviving the economy. We manufacture original products that we export to other countries. We are competitive against South African bonafide companies,” he said.  “Our plea is to have the Government assist in capacitating the company, which is able to save forex and promote local products.”       "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/legislator-proposes-jail-sentences-for-exchange-control-violators/,Legislator proposes jail sentences for exchange control violators,"Nqobile Bhebhe, [email protected] ZAKA South legislator, Dr Clemence Chiduwa, has proposed imposing jail sentences on repeat exchange control violators, labelling them as economic saboteurs, in addition to the suggested 200 000 ZiG penalty. Dr Chiduwa made the proposal while contributing to the amendment of the Exchange Control Act Notice 2024, a motion introduced by Deputy Minister of Finance, Economic Development,and Investment Promotion, David Mnangagwa. The motion aims to grant the Reserve Bank the authority to issue multiple penalty orders.  Furthermore, the proposed amendment includes the removal of a provision in the Schedule that previously permitted sellers of goods and services to sell at a 10 percent margin above the exchange rate. It also states that sellers will be deemed to commit a civil offence if they offer goods and services at prices exceeding the exchange rate published by the Reserve Bank. Deputy Minister Mnangagwa said the amendment seeks to, among other issues, have a fixed penalty of ZiG200 thousand for offenders in the Schedule. The penalty is meant to be a deterrent to those businesses that offer goods and services above the stipulated and market-determined exchange rate. “This 10 percent margin, while was fit for purpose before the Monetary Policy, is no longer fit for purpose,” Dep Minister Mnangagwa said.  The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) recently introduced ZiG to be used alongside other currencies as part of comprehensive monetary policy measures aimed at addressing exchange rate fluctuations, reducing inflation and restoring macro-economic stability in the country. Zimbabwe’s new currency is now supported by a mix of precious commodities, primarily gold and foreign currency reserves, with a total value of around US$285 million. While many economic players, such as manufacturers, retailers, key suppliers and other stakeholders have embraced the new currency for transactions, some resistance persists in specific sectors of the economy. Certain service providers, collaborating with speculative illegal money traders, are setting the ZiG exchange rate as high as 1:20 against the US dollar. The official rate is 13,5 to the US dollar. In his contribution, Dr Chiduwa said while a 200 000 ZiG penalty would be appropriate for offending individuals and institutions, a jail term would be much more deterrent. “I am proposing a jail term for repeat offenders. A jail term is very critical for those who are engaged in economic sabotage and those who are harming national interests. I think this is very critical. At this point, in the economic history of this country, we cannot afford to fail with regards to the ZiG,” he added. ZiG notes Dr Chiduwa noted that the operations of the black market, the parallel market rate is a cancer that is affecting the economic fabric of this country. “The parallel market rate is fighting the core values that define who we are in terms of where we want to be as a country. If you look at Vision 2030, it has about six pillars and I want to speak specifically on the pillar on macro-economic stability and financial re-engagement. Under the NDS1, there is a priority area on economic growth and stability. “If you look at NDS1, the Vision 2030, they are giving prominence to economic stability and financial re-engagement. All these will come to note when the core values of our economic fundamentals are being undermined by parallel market activities. “What we need to define from now on, going forward is, anyone who is fighting the vision of Zimbabwe is an economic saboteur. We need to clearly define that parallel market activities are economic crimes. These are economic crimes that are fighting literally everyone.”      "

He started exploring art at the age of nine, inspired by his namesake, Pablo Picasso. “I was named after Pablo Picasso, a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who was recognised as one of the most influential artists in the 20th century. I grew up in a family of artists and started drawing when I was nine years old. “During the Covid-19 lockdown, I started mastering my skills, specifically in portrait art. As I practiced, I got inspired by a South African artist called Young Creator,” he said. As his career progressed, Siziba found success, attracting clients and earning recognition for his work. He has since expanded his artistic horizons by venturing into the realms of Amapiano music and fashion using the medium of portrait art. Picasso Leon with Murumba Pitch Siziba has made a name for himself by sketching Amapiano musicians and presenting these portraits as gifts when they visit Zimbabwe. His work first caught the attention of industry figures like Bassie (Basetsana Kumalo) and Ambitious Entertainment. “The first artist I presented a portrait to was Young Stunna, who really appreciated it. This has motivated me to continue creating and hopefully make a living from my art,” he said. Siziba’s recent works include portraits of Amapiano duo Murumba Pitch and South African hip-hop stars Emtee and Kwesta. “My latest portrait project featured Murumba Pitch alongside South African hip-hop icons Emtee and Kwesta, who performed in Bulawayo on April 27 this year. It took me over two months to complete the portraits. “Among the notable figures I’ve depicted and presented portraits to are Musa Keys, Amaroto, Nkosazana Daughter, the late Costa Titch, Ami Faku, Tyler ICU, Sir Trill, Stokie as well as Zimbabwean artistes like Holyten and DJ Liz. Additionally, I have pending portraits for Cassper Nyovest, Felo le Tee, Mawhoo, DJ Maphorisa, Kabza de Small, Lady Du and many more,” he said. Picasso Leon and Kwesta Despite his success, Siziba faces significant hurdles. “Procuring materials and equipment is tough as they are scarce in our country,” he said. Siziba said some event promoters and organisers either sabotaged him or exploited him. “It’s difficult getting opportunities to showcase my works at events. There’s sabotage by the promoters and organisers leading to me being scammed or used by clients or event organisers. “Also, as fine artists, we’re taken for granted in places like Bulawayo. Art is not seen as something important or valued. I have been struggling to secure an art studio because even venues like the Bulawayo National Art Gallery have been unable to accommodate me,” said Siziba. He however, said his goal this year is to innovate his portrait style aiming to create storytelling portraits featuring prominent figures from around the world. Siziba said he will continue to present his artworks to celebrities as a marketing strategy to enhance his reputation.    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/a-widows-recipe-for-resilience/,A widow’s recipe for resilience,"Mbulelo Mpofu recently in Ntabazinduna Two years ago, Nomsa Tshuma’s world was irrevocably altered when her husband, Elvis Nyathi, fell victim to a barbaric xenophobic attack in Johannesburg, South Africa. The harrowing incident left her isolated and burdened with the sole responsibility of raising their four young children, as well as an immense emptiness in her heart. On April 6, 2022, in Diepsloot, Johannesburg, Nyathi was subjected to a violent assault by a group of protestors. The mob, driven by accusations against Zimbabwean nationals for local crimes, attacked and set Nyathi ablaze. Following this devastating event, his remains were laid to rest in Bulawayo in a State-assisted funeral. The shocking and untimely demise of Nyathi captured the nation’s attention, prompting widespread calls of support for his bereaved spouse. In those moments, it appeared that all hope was extinguished, as the wheels of justice turned agonising slow. Yet, in an unforeseen turn of events, Tshuma discovered a haven of solace and resilience at ACAJA Chillspot, a lively entertainment venue nestled in the Bhekeni Luthi area of Ntabazinduna. It is here that she has taken on the role of a cook.
During a visit by the Saturday Chronicle’s news team, Tshuma said ACAJA Chillspot has become a rejuvenating oasis in her life.  Her affiliation with the establishment has not only provided her with financial security, but has also imbued her with a renewed sense of purpose and community. “Ever since Abednico Dube (ACAJA Chillspot owner) offered me a job here, it hasn’t been smooth sailing, but a huge load of pressure has been relieved from my shoulders. The warm and supportive environment prevalent here has enabled me to heal and move forward, one delicious meal at a time. I am glad to be part of something special. “I was struggling to make ends meet and provide for my children after my husband’s brutal passing. I miss him, but being here helps me heal and try to forget everything. Since I started working at ACAJA Chillspot, I have been able to give my children a better life. They’re thriving, and that gives me the strength to keep going,” Tshuma said, her voice trembling with emotion. Tshuma’s culinary skills have become a source of solace, allowing her to express her emotions and channel her grief into something positive. The kitchen has become her sanctuary, where she finds peace and comfort in the simple act of cooking. “Cooking is my therapy. When I’m in the kitchen, I forget about my troubles and focus on creating something beautiful and nourishing for others. It’s a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there’s always hope for a brighter tomorrow,” Tshuma explained.  As she expertly prepared a sizzling dish for patrons, her face radiated a sense of pride and accomplishment. Although her husband may be gone, his memory lives on through the love and care she pours into every meal she prepares and the smiles she sees on patrons’ faces. “I am grateful for ACAJA Chillspot and the opportunity to work with such an amazing team which values my presence and contribution. Working closely with our site manager, Langelihle Nyathi, has been great because not only are we colleagues here, we are also close neighbours in the precinct. “ACAJA has given me a second chance at life, and I’m determined to make the most of it,” she said. — @MbuleloMpofu "

Tapiwanashe (32) is the first of two sons. He attended Milton Junior and Milton High School. While not particularly drawn to sports in his school days, Tapiwanashe went on to earn qualifications in accounting and even delved into Sports Science at both Nust and Unisa. Tapiwanashe landed his first accounting job at Edgars where he spent five years. Despite the lucrative nature of accounting, Tapiwanashe found himself increasingly drawn to fitness and began dedicating a significant portion of his free time to working out at the gym. He went on to participate in Mr Novice Zimbabwe in 2018 and gained a commendable runner-up finish. Later that year, he won Mr Africa Zimbabwe and was crowned the prestigious Fitness Icon of the Year in Nigeria. This victory motivated Tapiwanashe to take up the sport seriously, and he started competing in more competitions, winning more titles and enjoying it more. Tapiwanashe Zimhamba He has amassed a significant social media following, exceeding 85 000 fans and landed brand partnerships beyond Zimbabwe and collaborations with Verimark. In recognition of his achievements, Tapiwanashe was voted Zimbabwe’s Social Media Fitness Personality in 2023. “I used to participate in a lot of clubs at school like Debate and Interact, not sporting activities,” he said. “In those five years (at Edgars) I wasn’t satisfied so daily after work I would go hit the gym. Then one day I decided training other people was what I loved. I then started including other people in my training schedule and this kick started my fitness career.” The Mr Novice Zimbabwe competition in 2018 marked the start of Tapiwanashe’s competitive journey. “This competition gave me confidence and I could face my fears so I ended up doing fitness modelling which was a boost to my fitness career and that put me on the map,” he shared.  Tapiwanashe’s success continued in 2018. After winning Mr Africa Zimbabwe, he represented the nation at a competition in Nigeria. He founded Next Level (NXTLVL), a comprehensive fitness brand, which offers a range of sportswear, supplements, personalised nutritional advice and fitness training programmes. “NXTLVL is a sports brand that is going to take over Africa in the next two years. Like Nike and Adidas, it is going to be the biggest fitness sports brand spreading hope and motivation to the hopeless African child. “As NXTLVL, we also do charity work every Saturday at George Silundika and 9th Avenue called ‘Feed for Free Zimbabwe’ where we provide the homeless with a warm plate of food,” he said. His online presence has allowed him to connect with a wide audience and promote his various endeavours. In 2022, he ventured into acting, securing a role as a bodyguard to the character “Mrekza” on the popular South African soap opera, Generations the Legacy. The experience showcased his talents beyond fitness and modelling. Beyond his professional pursuits, Tapiwanashe enjoys cycling as a recreational activity that also maintains his fitness. “Cycling is a fantastic sport and recreational activity that offers numerous benefits, whether you’re a professional cyclist or just enjoying leisurely rides,” he says. He also continues his modelling career with Edgars. Demonstrating his commitment to inspiring others, Tapiwanashe co-hosts a weekly fitness show on Bulawayo’s Skyz Metro radio station alongside Taboka Nleya. Furthermore, his influence extended to being recognised among the top 50 influential Zimbabweans in South Africa.   "

Mothers around the world are celebrated for their tireless love and dedication. But the question remains — what’s the ideal Mother’s Day gift? A generic cake or the now-routine brunch reservation feels impersonal. It’s time to ditch the uninspired routine and truly spoil your mama. The Saturday Chronicle hit the streets of Bulawayo to ask mothers themselves what they crave most this year. Sithokozile Dube from Magwegwe suburb shared a heartfelt sentiment. Her greatest gift would be lasting love from her children, not just on Mother’s Day. It saddens her that some children use this day as a performative display of affection, neglecting their mothers throughout the year. “Once children are able to do that, it’s easy to get the perfect gift for your mother because you will know what it is that she wants and expects. “Most of our children just send us to these expensive lunches that we do not even like because it will be crowded and that’s not a great sight for most of us,” said Dube. Buhle Gumbo stressed the importance of thoughtful gifts. She suggested presents that are both useful and hold sentimental value — things a mother can see and use every day. Here are some ideas to inspire you, even after Mother’s Day has passed: Upgrade your mother’s space Has your mother been eyeing a new appliance or piece of furniture? Surprise her with a delivery. Imagine her delight relaxing on a new sofa or admiring a mounted TV after a long month. Renew and revive Is the kitchen paint peeling? Revamp it overnight for a fresh look! Replace those worn floor tiles she has been complaining about. For bigger dreams, consider building her a new home that’s if you can afford to! Even smaller fixes like repairing a leaky faucet can make a big difference. The gift of family There’s nothing more precious than quality time with loved ones. Plan a gathering where your mother can be surrounded by her children and grandchildren. Embrace the laughter, the playful chaos, and the inevitable (but memorable) family discussions. A taste of adventure Break the cake routine! Does your mum have food she’s always wanted to try? Take her to a new restaurant or introduce her to a unique cuisine. Plan an exciting outing like zip-lining or a boat cruise — create new memories together! Remember, these are just starting points. The most important thing is to make your mother feel truly special and loved, whether it’s through a thoughtful gift, a helping hand around the house, or simply spending quality time together. "

An award-winning author, unconventional entrepreneur and mental health advocate, Siziba shatters the mould of success. Hailing from Bulawayo, her journey is interlaced with resilience, innovation and an unwavering commitment to positive impact. From a young age, she displayed an insatiable curiosity and a fierce drive to excel. “Growing up, I was always a curious child. I played almost every sport in junior school and even joined the birds club, where we learned about various avian species. I vividly remember a moment when, amid a room full of relatives, I confidently declared that I wanted to be a businesswoman when I grow up. The laughter that ensued made me realise that I was different, destined for a path less travelled,” she recounted to Chronicle Showbiz. Her literary foray began as a path to personal healing. Writing became a cathartic release, allowing her to process emotions and find solace. As she shared her work on social media, she discovered a profound resonance with others. This connection propelled her to compile her writings into powerful books that ignite hope and champion mental well-being. Her debut book, “Why I Never Gave Up”, garnered global acclaim, winning the African Author Award in empowerment. It even received a nomination for best self-help book at the prestigious US Author Academy Awards. Princess Nomalanga Siziba Fuelled by her storytelling passion, Princess established “WING UP Publishing,” empowering individuals to share their narratives with authenticity and impact. Guided by the belief that every story holds value, Princess fostered a publishing house attracting clients globally, spanning the UK, Germany, China and South Africa. Remarkably, she achieved this entirely virtually, operating from her mother’s house in Cowdray Park. Beyond literary triumphs, Siziba has made significant strides in the skincare industry. Inspired by her own battles with severe teenage acne, she embarked on a year-long research odyssey to unearth natural solutions. “What most people don’t know is that I was one of those teens who struggled with severe acne. I’d even be teased at school with one student once saying to me, ‘your skin looks like a bar of soap that has been rolling in sand’ in reference to how rough and grainy my skin looked. “My confidence and self-esteem took a knock and I started wearing hats a lot at school to cover the acne. As I matured into adulthood I was still dealing with that acne. I’d go broke just trying to fix my skin as I would go for the most expensive acne treatments thinking it would help me and eventually, I got tired of it all and decided to commit to a year of researching on natural skin solutions. That’s until I stumbled on an article about Zumbani tea,” she said.  Fuelled by a year of research, her unwavering determination crystallised into “Indalo” in 2021. This ground-breaking brand, Zimbabwe’s first 100 percent vegan and organic skincare line, takes pride in Zumbani tea as its unique hero ingredient. Backed by science, Indalo’s products harness the power of Zumbani tea’s rich antioxidants to nurture healthy skin. Siziba’s relentless drive has garnered well-deserved recognition. In 2022, she was crowned one of the top 100 Zim Achievers and Influencers in Matabeleland. The same year, she triumphed at the Zimbabwe Business Youth Expo, earning the prestigious recognition of the United Nations — a testament to her exceptional entrepreneurial spirit. Most recently, she secured the coveted best innovation award under ZimTrade’s Export incubator programme, solidifying her position as a visionary leader in the skincare industry. “Participating in the Zimbabwe Business Youth Expo was a life-changing experience. It opened doors, instilled confidence and helped people trust the Indalo brand even more. The recognition I received has propelled my aspirations and I now firmly believe that Indalo can become a global brand to be reckoned with,” she said. Siziba’s journey as a businesswoman is deeply rooted in her experience with the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE). She credits the programme for equipping her with the essential foundation to thrive. AWE instilled in her the importance of a strong Unique Selling Proposition (USP), allowing her business, Indalo, to stand out from the crowd upon launch. Siziba leverages the power of storytelling in both her business and advocacy efforts. Recognising the impact of emotional connection, she integrates compelling narratives to drive success. Indalo products Her passion extends beyond entrepreneurship. Drawing on her experiences and wisdom, she champions mental well-being and strives to uplift and inspire others. “When others heal, I heal too. My purpose is to serve through my writing and entrepreneurial pursuits, sharing the things that have helped me overcome challenges and motivated me to rise again.” Siziba urged young authors and entrepreneurs to shun procrastination. “Start right where you are. My journey began in Cowdray Park, the least likely place for people to succeed, but I dared to believe that I could be the first of something. Starting is half the battle won. A year from now you’ll be proud that you started,” she said. As an avid reader and YouTube videos enthusiast, Siziba also loves travelling. Unbeknown to a lot of people, Siziba has also tried her hand in music as she once won a singing competition at the late Cont Mhlanga’s Amakhosi Theatre when she was in high school, but due to lack of mentorship, “the passion kind of disappeared”. Looking ahead, Siziba envisions a future filled with innovation and expansion.

To address this gap, last month she started the Girl Get Up Movement, a women’s empowerment programme aimed at young women and teenagers. The initiative provides a space in which women can share strategies and insights to navigate daily difficulties. It has received requests to expand to other cities and Michele hopes to collaborate with other organisations offering psychological, mental and social support to women. Some of the women who attended the girl get up movement   “I remember there was a time when I was in a dark place and I had no one to confide in. It became so bad to an extent that I lost weight and was thinking of taking my own life. When I looked at my own situation, I realised there are so many other young people who are going through the same thing and they have no one to turn to, that’s why I decided to start this movement so that it could be a safe space for such women,” said Michele. The project’s first session focused on learning to manage pain from past experiences, conducted with the help of a therapist.  “Most women are hurting because of past events that is why we decided to start with a letting go session. Because of these past events we are holding on to, our mental health and social lives end up being affected. “During the session, girls wrote down all hurtful things they now want to let go on a glass plate, so they could move on with life. As a sign of breaking from those, we all smashed the plates. The next session is going to be the ‘Sis Are You Ok’ movement. It’s going to be like a follow up to what we did just to talk about how the girls are doing after the letting go session,” she said.  “My greatest drive is to help other women and our hope for the future is inviting organisations which are also into psychological, mental and social support such as Friendship Bench, Zwala and Musasa, who deal with women protection. Some cases that come up in our sessions need strong psychological counselling, support and legal representation. Once we have those partnerships. We can be able to direct those cases to those organisations and work hand-in-hand with them,” said Michele. — @flora_sibanda "

The book is set to be launched tomorrow at Hope City Centre Church in the CBD. The book launch will be hosted by Bryce Andiswa Dube and graced by guest of honour – veteran playwright Raisedon Baya with fellow guest speakers, rapper Meet Luminous and Annie Litso. Entertainment will be provided by Skaiva, Bongy, Mega and Dr MTK. Historically, “Jane the Ghost” is a modern adaptation of a long-standing urban legend from Bulawayo. The myth has been handed down through the ages, captivating each generation with its eerie tale.  According to stories, Jane was believed to be a ghost who assumed the guise of a prostitute during the late 1980s and early 1990s. She became infamous for her deceitful tactics, luring unsuspecting men into her web of deception characterised by her uncanny ability to vanish without a trace at Pelandaba Cemetery, leaving her bewildered victims behind. Asani told Chronicle Showbiz that he only relays his version of events with regards to Jane the Ghost.“This is my debut body of work based on an urban legend from the streets of Bulawayo about a well-known lady of the night who was murdered in her line of work. Later, she came back from the dead to seek justice for her to truly rest in peace. It carries with it a mystery, thriller and a lot of crime investigation,” he said. Asani worked alone on this project but said his upcoming book, which he intends to release next year will be a collaboration with a surprise well-known author in Bulawayo.

Born into a musical family in Nkayi, Mpofu began showcasing his vocal talents in grade 4, performing at his local SDA church and school. At 14, Mpofu joined the Gonye AY choir as a tenor. He recalls, “I remember dreaming about singing new songs on stage. I didn’t take it seriously at the time because I was young.” Despite his early visions, establishing his first group in 2005 proved challenging due to his father’s disapproval of church-related activities. The group eventually disbanded, but this setback didn’t deter him.  In 2009, he formed “Witnesses of Christ” with all members originating from Nkayi. Although most belonged to the Followers of Christ Church, the group also included members from other denominations such as AFM and UCCSA. Financial struggles were a constant hurdle, especially since Mpofu was unemployed at the time. He recounted, “I was already composing my own contemporary songs. We participated in competitions in Nkayi and our church, and we were a winning group.” In 2011, the group’s breakthrough came when they travelled to Bulawayo to record a six-track album with Video Visions studios. Unfortunately, due to a lack of systematic planning, the album did not achieve the expected success, leading Mpofu to re-record it in 2012.  Their 2013 attempt to release a 10-track album was thwarted by unresolved debts with the late producer, Joe Maseko, and the album was never collected. Driven by his faith and dedication to the gospel, Mpofu continues to pursue his music career against all odds.
“I sing gospel because I live the gospel; it’s my life. I am a servant of God, called to this path, and I must follow what I feel inside,” he expressed passionately. His multifaceted career also spans roles as a registry clerk and a pastor, showcasing his diverse skill set. Looking to the future, Mpofu is excited about his latest project, a 2024 gospel album titled “I Bow Before You” featuring six Ndebele tracks and two in English. He remains committed to uncovering and nurturing hidden talents in Nkayi and the broader Matabeleland region, not only in music but also in poetry and visual arts. “There is hidden talent in Nkayi which I wish to bring to light. If you can dream it, you can achieve it. Let’s stand up, campaign, and showcase our talent. The light has already been put on and it’s growing; together, we can make it,” he concluded, filled with optimism. Ends// "

Senior Reporter THE better team of the day is highly likely to get both the three points at stake as well as the support from the terraces when Manica Diamonds host Bikita Minerals at Sakubva Stadium in a Castle Lager Premiership encounter set for Sunday. Both Manica Diamonds and Bikita Minerals use Sakubva Stadium as their home ground, and so far they have all enjoyed the backing of the hard to please Mutare football fans. With Manica Diamonds now on second position on the Castle Lager Premiership table following their sudden resurgence which has seen the Mutare diamond miners going for six consecutive matches collecting maximum points, Sunday’s league encounter presents yet another stern test of character for coach, Jairos Tapera and his men. On the other hand, Bikita Minerals have been enjoying considerable support of local fans each time they are at Sakubva Stadium due to their exciting passing game, a known trademark style of play for teams coached by veteran gaffer, Saul Chaminuka. Thus, Tapera, reckons the challenge posed by the lithium miners in their fine run. “We respect Bikita Minerals as they have been posting very good results. Remember, we are sharing the same stadium as our home ground, and the same supporters making it an interesting derby. “We are preparing well for this encounter. We will play with a positive mind. We have been doing well of late, and we would like to continue with that fine run,” said Tapera. The former Young Warriors gaffer attributes his club’s fine run to the hard work and commitment that all members of his team have invested in the project. “We attribute our fine run to hard work being put by the players. The level of commitment is just impressive. I believe this also has more to do with team work by both players and technical team,” said Tapera.    Bikita Minerals Saul Chaminuka He said they are not reading too much into their current position on the table, and are only concerned with collecting maximum points with each passing match. “We are not looking at the position we are at the log. It is still very early. We are just working hard to maintain the form and try and win as many matches as possible,” said Tapera. His opposite number, Chaminuka understands the enormity of the task ahead of him and his club. Chaminuka said: “This is the game of the year for both teams as either side knows how important winning this game is. “We are sister clubs fighting for bragging rights, and the good thing is that we are all home this week. The team that settles first and handles the fire thrown at it well will win. “Mutare fans are in for a treat this weekend. I promise them fireworks during Sunday’s match at Sakubva Stadium. Sakubva will be the best place to be after church.” Chaminuka hinted that he is staying put at Bikita Minerals after several clubs expressed the desire to lure him. “I am at Bikita and this Sunday, I want our fans to concentrate on pushing our boys so that we come out of this one with maximum points. We want to amass as many points as we can so that we end this first round with points that will see us instead of being threatened with relegation, we will be fighting for a top six finish. “I believe that achievement will be like winning a title in our debut season.

Participants in the course went through lessons in entries in competitions at international standards, attire, officials’ categories, running events, field events (jumping and throwing events), race walking, combined events (heptathlon, octathlon, and decathlon), indoor athletics and anti-doping. International instructor, Irene Chineka, one of the only three instructors in Zimbabwe, was the chief facilitator during the well-attended course. Chineka said: “This is the third course of its nature that we are having this year around the country, and we are happy with the response we are getting from our targeted participants. It really shows that we have come of age in athletics as we now understand the importance of technical expertise in managing our competitions. “It is important to note that this course is crucial in enhancing the professional approach to athletics competition management, and it is recognised globally. These participants can officiate anywhere under the sun with this qualification. Therefore, we congratulate them for the sacrifice they have made to be here, and hopefully, they will play an important role in nurturing our budding athletes.” Mutare Athletics Board chairperson, Godfrey Ndinangepi, who was also the assistant facilitator during the recent course at Sakubva Primary School, said: “As Mutare Athletics Board, one of the seven boards we have here in Manicaland under Manicaland Athletics Board, we are excited to have managed to host this event successfully. We strongly believe we have played a huge role in capacitating our athletics officials, and this should culminate into more professional handling of our competitions.”   "

Sports Correspondent CRICKETERS and sports personalities have been urged to take a firm stance against performance-enhancing drugs and abuse of other drugs and substances as they can have detrimental effects for both the individual athlete and the integrity of the sport. Addressing young cricketers and sportsmen at Mutare Sports Club last Saturday, Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Misheck Mugadza said a nation with drugged people cannot develop. The event was hosted by the Premier Cricket Academy and was held under the theme: “Batting Away Substance Abuse”. “We must take a stand and actively work towards creating a society that is free from the clutches of substance abuse. Only a healthy society can stand resolute to develop its country. Just as you use your skills and determination to bat away every ball that comes your way, we must collectively work to bat away the lure of drugs and substance abuse from our communities. “As cricketers, you have a unique platform to inspire and educate the masses. Your dedication, teamwork and perseverance on the sports field are qualities that many look up to and aspire to emulate. It is, therefore, crucial that you recognise the influence you have, and use it to advocate for a drug-free society. The use of drugs in sport and in the society, not only affects the individual, but also has a profound impact on families, communities, and the nation at large. “More importantly, let us band together, like a strong cricket team, to bat away substance abuse. Let us educate, support and empower our communities to make informed decisions and reject the allure of drugs. Together, we can be champions, not only in cricket, but also in the fight against drug abuse,” said Mugadza. He added that drug and substance abuse also has health implications. “For example, anabolic steroid abuse result in cardiovascular problems, hormonal imbalances and increased aggression. Stimulant abuse can cause heart problems, anxiety and addiction. Additionally, the use of blood doping techniques can lead to blood clotting, stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Our dear cricketers, use your influence to spread awareness, support anti-drug initiatives, and be vocal advocates for a drug free lifestyle. Your actions, both on and off the field can inspire positive and change the world,” he said. Manicaland cricket administrator, Terry Nyakurimwa said: “The use of drugs and substance abuse by youths is now a major concern. We urge kids to come and play cricket and shun all social ills.”   "

Senior Reporter   THE 2024 edition of the rebranded Mwana Rugby Festival has come and gone, but the boost in talent development at national scale will remain its greatest legacy, while participants from Manicaland Province are still counting the sporting as well as social gains of having been part of the 120 schools that took part in the competition. Mavhudzi High, one of the three schools from Manicaland that participated in the competition held in Harare last week, played three matches like the rest of the teams that participated. Of those three matches, Mavhudzi played against Dzivarasekwa, Tichakunda and Pathway Group of Schools. They won the first match, drew the second and lost the last one. Mavhudzi High School coach, Takudzwa Mudzuka, said: “It was a learning curve for the team as a whole, and hopefully we will have three wins during the next edition of the tournament. We played very well during our first two matches, but injuries saw us having five key players being retired to the bench during the last match. “Everyone played well, but our captain, Ashley Tsar Chimbandidza and Blessing Boika Murangwana were instrumental in rallying the team.” Marist Nyanga and Mutare Boys’ High School were the other two schools that participated. Mwana Group proprietor, Kuda Mutenda said: “Some of the success areas include the fact that rugby was played at all levels, by 120 teams (8am to 5pm, over seven days). This is the only rugby tournament which attracts a number of schools as they don’t have leagues during the year. “Long term infrastructural improvements and developments to the host school were also witnessed. More than 250 people were trained in five different courses (Level One Coaching, Level One Referees, Level One Medics, Sports Science and Sports Administration) free of charge to the participants. “People who normally do not watch rugby were given a chance to watch and enjoy rugby. In short, we gave hope to the country. ?50 talented and promising (boys and girls) athletes were selected for specialised further development to fully realise their potential over the next 12 months, with a regional tour to Zambia in 2024 in the pipeline. “It is also worth noting that this competition defied social barriers, as all social classes were represented and enhanced participation of women and the girl child, both on and off the pitch. “Lastly, but equally important is the fact that we aggressively campaigned against drug abuse through the whole festival, with over 1 000 learners going through counselling sessions from qualified doctors and counsellors from Drug Free Zim,” said Mutenda. Manicaland Rugby Board chairperson, Mos Kapumha, said: “We would like to appreciate the school heads who made it possible for their schools to be part of this national festival, the biggest and longest running in Zimbabwe – The Mwana Festival. “The players, both boys and girls, were given good quality opponents and exposed to the country’s finest rugby playing schools. The coaches’ tactics and credentials were put to test. “A big thank you to the organiser, Kuda Mutenda and his Mwana Festival committee for embarking on this journey and giving our learners a platform and opportunity to express their talents, skills and humility on such a grand stage. “We have 10 rugby referring officials who were part of these games. They were giving their services and also horning their skills. One of them was Eve Chisingarambwi, a new certified Rugby Africa match commissioner. It was a first for Manicaland. The Mwana Festival Super Week also came with a training and education programme which saw three Manicaland participants, two ladies and one male getting certified across different strands accredited by World Rugby.”   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/i-feel-so-sorry-for-him-no-kane-no-gain-for-bayern/,"‘I feel so sorry for him’ – No Kane, no gain for Bayern","The ManicaPost   WHEN Harry Kane was on the pitch, Bayern Munich were heading to the Champions League final.   When he wasn’t there, they weren’t — and aren’t. Thomas Tuchel substituted Kane in the 85th minute against Real Madrid.   At that point, Bayern were protecting a one-goal lead and were going to Wembley with the England captain having led their charge. So while there are other factors in play — notably Manuel Neuer’s error as he spilled the ball to allow Joselu his first of a dramatic late double, plus Madrid’s innate ability to win big European games even when hope seems lost — the substitution has been pinpointed as the turning point. It also encapsulates what the 2023-24 season has been for Bayern — a campaign where they have looked lost when without Kane. And now, Kane ends his debut campaign at Bayern with nothing. “He has done his job. He has scored the goals,” Champions League winner Rio Ferdinand told TNT Sports. “They brought him to continue winning trophies and I feel the others have let him down more than anything. I think he will have a heavy heart tonight.” While Bayern were after the seventh European Cup in their history, Kane was looking for the first major trophy of an otherwise stellar career. Certainly, this season could not have been better from an individual perspective for Kane, scoring 44 goals in all competitions — his best ever scoring season. Yet while Kane has shone, this flawed Bayern side have fallen short and will end the season without a major trophy for the first time since 2011-12. “I feel so sorry for Kane. What a superstar he has been and he doesn’t have an opportunity [in a Champions League final],” former Bayern midfielder Owen Hargreaves told TNT Sport. “Poor guy. He has been amazing this season and that just didn’t go to plan in the last 10 minutes.” In that 2011-12 campaign when Bayern finished empty-handed, Kane was finishing a season on loan from Tottenham to Millwall, where he scored seven goals in 22 League One games and was still a year away from his Premier League debut. This season, he has almost singlehandedly tried to drag Bayern to glory. Bayern’s second highest scorer, Jamal Musiala – also subbed off in Madrid – has just 12 goals in all competitions. However, hampered by poor performances and bad decisions around him, Kane has come up just short. Bayern lost their 11-year grip on the Bundesliga title to Bayer Leverkusen, were knocked out of the German Cup by third-tier Saarbrucken and now they will be stunned having seemed set for an all-German final in the Champions League. After a quiet opening quarter of the match at the Santiago Bernabeu, Kane sprung to life with a snap volley from the D in the 28th minute which Andriy Lunin had to go full stretch down to his left to save. But Bayern around him were again off the pace, with a passive showing that saw Madrid dominate. Only a series of fine saves from Neuer kept the tie level, until Kane made his most telling intervention. Alphonso Davies’ strike with his supposed weaker right foot to put Bayern ahead on the night caught the eye, but it was Kane who made the play by dropping deep, then spraying an idea pass out to the left for the Canadian full-back to take on, cut inside and fire home. Kane’s value to Bayern stretches way beyond goals.   He even led the complaints to the referee when Nacho shoved Joshua Kimmich in the face before Madrid appeared to have equalised, prior to the goal being ruled out by VAR. But then came the turning point, as with five minutes remaining Tuchel replaced Kane with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as part of a series of changes to try and see out the match. “That will be viewed as the moment Tuchel lost this for Bayern,” German football expert Archie Rhind-Tutt told BBC Radio 5 Live. “You could see it in his facial expression after the second Madrid goal went in – he looked shaken. He usually has a very good poker face, Tuchel. That for me was a guy who knew it had all gone wrong.” Tuchel, due to depart at the end of the season, defended his call, saying Kane was in no state to continue. “He couldn’t keep going. He played with back pain and he couldn’t keep going, his back froze up,” Tuchel said. Shortly before Kane came off, Choupo-Moting’s fellow former Stoke City player Joselu was thrown on by Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti — and he snatched the striking glory. As the Real players streaked on to the pitch to celebrate Joselu’s winner, Kane was left in the away team dugout to wonder what might have been. – BBCsport.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/maradonas-stolen-golden-ball-to-be-auctioned-off/,Maradona’s ‘stolen’ Golden Ball to be auctioned off,"The ManicaPost   DIEGO Maradona’s “stolen” Golden Ball trophy, awarded for being named the best player at the 1986 World Cup, has been found and will be auctioned off in France on 6 June. The Aguttes auction house announced on Tuesday that the item had resurfaced and they expect it to be sold for “millions”. Maradona, who died in 2020, won the award after leading Argentina to World Cup victory in Mexico. “There are a lot of stories and legends, like it was stolen by the mafia to make gold,” the Aguttes auction house sport expert Francois Thierry told BBC Sport.   “We did all the necessary checks and called the police about it. “We have had the ball for about one year. We did a lot of research about it since there are a lot of details in terms of manufacturer comments until we could say it was a good one.” The Golden Ball was bought by the anonymous seller in 2016 at an auction in France. However, he was unaware what item he had purchased. “He bought it with many other things, at the beginning he did not know it was something important,” Thierry added. “In the case he bought there were a lot of trophies. He then searched on the internet and found it could be the Golden Ball. “He tried to call Maradona and Fifa, but had no luck.” The 1986 World Cup arguably is best remembered for Maradona’s two goals against England in the quarter-finals. Maradona outjumped England keeper Peter Shilton to punch his first goal into the net with a raised fist, which was later described by the Argentine as being scored by the “Hand of God”. His second was voted as the “Goal of the Century” in a Fifa poll, Maradona dribbling from his own half past five English players to score. Both the jersey he wore that day, along with the ball from the match, have previously been sold at auction for millions. “The trophy symbolises the pinnacle of his career and he is the player of the century,” Thierry said. “We can see there were some results from before when his jersey against England in 1986 being sold for I think £9m and the ball of the game went for £2m, so we expect millions.” — Online.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/i-dont-trust-anyone-how-trolling-hurt-kipchoge/,‘I don’t trust anyone’: How trolling hurt Kipchoge,"The ManicaPost   TWO-TIME Olympic champion Eliud Kipchoge says he feared for the lives of his family during a campaign of online abuse that wrongly linked him to the death of fellow Kenyan marathon runner Kelvin Kiptum. Kiptum, the world record holder who looked set to challenge Kipchoge’s dominance over 26.2 miles, died aged 24 in a car crash in February. Some social media users began to speculate that Kipchoge was part of a conspiracy to kill Kiptum, who had lowered the world best to two hours, 35 seconds last October in Chicago. “I was shocked that people [on] social media platforms are saying ‘Eliud is involved in the death of this boy’,” the 39-year-old told BBC Sport Africa. “That was my worst news ever in my life. “I received a lot of bad things; that they will burn the (training) camp, they will burn my investments in town, they will burn my house, they will burn my family. “It did not happen but that is how the world is.” Kipchoge’s initial reaction when he saw the abuse and false rumours was to check whether his family were safe. “I don’t have power to go to police and tell them my life is in danger. So my concern was actually to tell my family to be extra conscious and cautious,” he said. “I started to call a lot of people. “I got really scared of my children going to school and coming back. “Sometimes they bike around, but we had to stop them because you never know what will happen. We started to drop them [off] and pick them [up] in the evening. “My girl was in boarding school – that was positive that she had no access as far as social media is concerned – but it’s tough for my boys to hear ‘Your dad has killed somebody’.” Kipchoge was overtaken by emotion during a candid interview at his home in Eldoret when discussing the impact the campaign of abuse had on his mother. “My worst moment was (when) I tried to call my mum,” he said. “She told me ‘Just take care’ and ‘A lot has been going on’. “Where I come from is a really local area. And with the age of my mum, I really realised that social media can go everywhere. “But she gave me courage. It was really a tough month.” However, Kipchoge, who became just the third person to win successive Olympic marathons when he defended his title in Tokyo in 2021, decided not to take precautions over his own safety. “I saw no meaning to change training venues because my life is open,” he explained. “Our sport is not training in the gym, it is going outside to run. I walk in the streets freely.”
Kipchoge claims he “lost about 90 percent” of his friends amid the wrongful link to Kiptum’s accident and online abuse. “It was really painful for me to learn even from my own people, my training mates, those who I have contact with, and the bad words are coming from them,” he added. “I was really down to see that.” Kipchoge’s team decided to take the distance runner off social media in the wake of the abuse, but he said he never considered deleting his accounts. “If I delete my accounts then it shows that there is something I am hiding,” he said. “I will keep my accounts. I did not do anything.” However, he believes the social media abuse affected his performance in competition. Kipchoge came 10th in the Tokyo Marathon on 3 March, his lowest finish since his debut in 2013, crossing the line over two and a half minutes behind the winner Benson Kipruto. “When I was in Tokyo I had three days which I did not sleep,” he revealed. “It was my worst ever position.” Despite that setback he was named in Kenya’s marathon team for the Paris 2024 Olympics last Wednesday, and is now focused on creating more history at the Games as he aims to win a third successive gold medal. “It’s about getting up and going straight again, to your goal,” added Kipchoge, who in 2019 became the first person to run a marathon in under two hours, albeit in controlled conditions in Vienna. “I want to go into history books, to be the first human being to win back-to-back-to-back.”
Having been on the receiving end of intimidation and threats, Kipchoge believes social media companies are “not doing much” to clamp down on abuse on their platforms. “These faceless people are posting bad things and are really dangerous,” he said. “If you report some accounts then it takes time for them to delete those accounts. “They should act fast, get the facts, delete accounts. People [should] know that if you say something which is not good then your account will be deleted.” However, Kipchoge has welcomed an announcement from the International Olympic Committee that it plans to “respond proactively and at scale” to safeguard athletes from online abuse during Paris 2024. The IOC intends to use artificial intelligence, external to help identify abusive posts and report them to social media companies. “I think it’s actually the right direction,” he said. “They are now stamping their authority and their function as an organisation handling the athletes to safeguard them from abuse.” But, for Kipchoge, it is already too late to avoid the emotional scarring he has suffered.
“I learned that friendship cannot be forever,” he said. “I think it’s unfortunate that it happened when I’m celebrating over 20 years in sport. “What happened has [made] me not trust anybody. Even my own shadow, I will not trust.” — BBCsport.   "

Senior Reporter THERE is something crazy about the game of football — perhaps that is where its beauty lies! The first four rounds of the 2024 Castle Lager Premiership matches saw Manica Diamonds lying in the relegation zone on the log table — having conceded seven goals in four matches. In fact, after Match Day Three, Manica Diamonds anchored the log table. Amid speculation over his job, their coach, Jairos Tapera, even admitted that failing to get a win in the opening four matches of the season was worrisome. At that point, Tapera felt that the team’s defence was their weakest link. “As the head coach, I am very worried about the way we have been conceding, especially in our first two games, but we have been working very hard on that area (defence) and what we now need is to improve on our confidence,” he said then. Fast forward to five weekends, Manica Diamonds eased into the second position on the log table after an impressive five matches unbeaten run. And last Sunday, second half super substitute, Michael Tapera blasted a hard and low shot off a rebound after a corner kick to give Manica Diamonds their first triumph over FC Platinum since joining the Premiership, and also their fifth victory on the bounce. Against all odds, the club has been winning home and away, much to the amusement of Tapera. “We always attribute everything to God who has blessed us as a team to work and understand each other. These boys are all my sons. We have a father and son relationship, and always reflect on previous games and try to find information on our next opponents so that we can work on ways to overcome them. “We are a team full of ambitions, we really want to win something as a team,” said Tapera.    Manica Diamonds goalkeeper, Godfrey Chitsumba has also performed well between the sticks He believes the change of fortunes has been a direct result of shear hard work by all members of the team. “Every member of our team is putting a very strong performance. Yes, we can mention a few, but that will not take away what every player has put in, even those not selected on a particular day still work hard at training,” he said. The former Young Warriors gaffer admitted that winger, Michael Tapera was in a terrific form. Apart from sharing the same surname and team, the two namesakes are not biologically related. Apart from speedy winger, Tapera, who is nicknamed Chimudhudhudhu, goalkeeper, Godfrey Chitsumba has also been a vital cog in their transformation. Interestingly, it is the same defence that a few weeks ago has been leaking goals like a sieve, which has transformed into the solid bedrock of Tapera’s success story. “Yes, Michael Tapera has done very well for us with three goals in five matches. We also have Farai Banda who has two goals in as many matches. “We have our defence which has done very well with only a goal conceded in the last five matches. We also have our goalkeeper who has garnered four clean sheets in five matches,” he said. Manica Diamonds will face ZPC Kariba in their next assignment, and Tapera fully understands the threat posed by Kauya Kuturuturu. “It is very difficult to maintain form. We are going to ZPC Kariba, and this is even a more difficult assignment, considering that they have been performing very well in their recent matches. They have been posting impressive results at home and away. “We respect them a lot, but we are preparing and taking that match like any other important away game. We are going there to compete and give it all our best to get a positive result,” said Tapera.   "

Senior Reporter CASTLE Lager Premiership debutants, Bikita Minerals are holding on to him, GreenFuel and Hwange want him, while TelOne has placed a counter offer on the table to lure him. His name is Saul Chaminuka. After parting ways with head coach, Rodwell Dhlakama, the Chisumbanje-based Green Fuel-based outfit, whose turnover of coaches is fast becoming worrisome even to its sympathizers, is now chasing the signature of Saul Chaminuka. GreenFuel chairman, Fred Moyo confirmed their undying love for the experienced gaffer. “Yes, we are keen to have Saul Chaminuka on board. We are engaging him and our negotiations are at an advanced stage. We have every hope that he will settle for GreenFuel. Anytime from now we could be announcing his arrival at GreenFuel,” said Moyo. On the competition that his club is facing in signing Chaminuka, the GreenFuel boss said: “That is the nature of the game. Saul Chaminuka is a good coach, no doubt about that. Therefore, it is not surprising that many clubs are after him. However, I hope we will be able to meet and exceed his expectations.” The former now defunct Eastern Lions coach, Chaminuka is highly rated in domestic top-flight league as a shrewd tactician who can achieve results even with an average side. To lend credence to Chaminuka’s capabilities, Bikita Minerals did not have meaningful pre-season preparations as they were locked in some boardroom Premiership promotion issue that involved Tenax FC, but the team is competing favourably, playing an entertaining brand of football. This also explains Bikita Minerals’ reluctance to release the experienced gaffer. However, information gleaned by this newspaper indicate that Bikita Minerals are not adequately remunerating their players and coaches with unconfirmed reports that they are owed about four months’ salaries. This leaves the gaffer thinking twice should a striking offer be tabled.   "

Senior Reporter IT’S two steps forward and one step backwards for the development of rugby in Manicaland after the once enterprising rural-based Sahumani Secondary School girls team failed to make the trip to Harare for this year’s inaugural Mwana Rugby Festival due to lack of resources. The festival was previously known as Dairibord Rugby Festival, which is arguably the country’s biggest annual rugby competition. The festival was previously bankrolled by milk and milk products producer, Dairibord, before takeover this year by Mwana Group, which manufactures vehicles accessories and doubles as a trucks and buses dealer. But it is this year’s absence of Sahumani Secondary School girls team — hailing from the undulating terrain and deep thickets of Honde Valley — that easily captures the attention of those who have been following their Cinderella story in the game of rugby. When the girls at Sahumani Secondary School started playing rugby back in 2017, they had to make do with the soccer pitch and the oversized football shirts used by the boys. Five years down the line, several of the girls ere representing the country in the sport, while girl rights activists credited the project for saving them from becoming child brides. Manicaland Rugby Board chairperson, Mos Kapumha admitted that the absence of Sahumani is testimony of lack of grassroots sport support in rural areas. “Our plea is for corporates, local businesspeople and politicians to help support the development of sport. This helps to bridge the gap between societies, be it either in sport or academics and at tertiary or school level. This lack of support also stifles the growth of the game in marginalised areas and demoralises the players and coaches who would have worked hard and sacrificed their time and effort, only to be let down on the 11th hour by lack of resources. “So there is need for collective support from parents, school administrators, community leaders and the business community to make sure that these players’ dreams are nurtured and actualised,” he said. However, Manicaland is not without its representatives at this year’s edition of the competition after Mavhudzi High boys and girls, Mutare Boys’ High and Marist Brothers Under-16 as well as senior teams are in attendance. “As Manicaland, we are pleased with Mavhudzi High, Marist Brothers and Mutare Boys’ High School’s participation at the inaugural Mwana Rugby Festival. “These teams were drawn from three districts out of seven. Sahumani failed to travel at the 11th hour from Mutasa North in Honde Valley due to lack of funds. “The participation of the three schools is good and shows that rugby is alive and thriving in schools in the province. It shows a great deal of commitment even from the school administrators towards sport and providing equal opportunities for their learners and a balanced curriculum. This also helps to prepare these schools for the upcoming national and provincial schools rugby league. Manicaland will have a schools’ rugby league starting in May when schools open. “Mutare Boys’ High and Hillcrest will be taking part in the CBZ national schools league. Manicaland schools will be busy this second term playing in structured rugby leagues provincially and nationally in line with the National Development Strategy (NDS1),” he said.   In the ongoing Mwana Rugby Festival which ends on Sunday, Mavhudzi was its Under-20 boys edging Dzivarasekwa 12-7 on Monday.   "

Senior Reporter MUTARE is poised to host one of the biggest ever boxing event when Charles Manyuchi descends on the city for a blockbuster heavyweight bout against the province’s best pugilist — Anesu “The Guy” Motsi. The bout is being promoted by BoxAfrica Limited, an entity duly registered with Zimbabwe National Boxing and Wrestling Control Board, with jewellery firm, Betterbrands having expressed a keen interest to come on board as a principal sponsor. Betterbrands director and Mabvuku-Tafara Member of Parliament, Scott Sakupwanya is not new to boxing after sponsoring celebrated boxer, Floyd Mayweather’s visit to Zimbabwe in 2023. The visit was dubbed: “The Homeland Tour”. Themed: “The Grand Finale – KnockOut Drug Abuse Now,” the contest is being earmarked for this winter, with Sakubva Stadium being the preferred venue, albeit pending availability. Information at hand indicates that the promoter intends to include four boxers from Malawi on the rich fight card so as to give an international flair to the tournament. Manyuchi (34) who is arguably the most decorated boxer in the country, has since indicated that he is on the verge of spiking his gloves after an eventful professional career that earned him a total 13 international titles. These include the African Boxing Union welterweight belt, World Boxing Council international and silver, World Boxing Federation world, Global Boxing Union, Universal Boxing Union, World Professional Boxing Federation and the World Alliance Boxing Association supreme titles. In a journey that spans two decades, the sports ambassador boasts of 29 victories, 18 of them knockouts; four loses and a single draw in the professional ranks. It is this feat that earned him the Annual National Sports Awards’ Sportsman and Sportsperson of the Year gongs in two consecutive years – 2015 and 2016. He has also been twice hosted by the country’s two Presidents, and handed tokens of appreciation for having hoisted the Zimbabwe’s flag high. Promoter, Gilbert Munetsi, who is also Manyuchi’s publicist, advisor and biographer confirmed that plans are at an advanced stage to have Manyuchi fight before his fans in Mutare. “I can confirm that we have covered some ground in arranging this milestone event, and it is our fervent hope that Mutare folks will be treated to the best a promoter can offer in terms of a boxing bill. “I can confirm that we have now been given the greenlight by the boxing sanctioning board to have the tournament after meeting the initial requirements expected of us. “While we have had a positive discussion with Betterbrands, it is our hope that the business community in Mutare will also seize the opportunity and join hands with us. They will reap benefits from associating with the brand Charles Manyuchi. “It is an event that happens once in a lifetime, and the most beneficiaries in this arrangement remain the corporate sector and residents of Mutare in general,” he said.
Manyuchi, who was last in Mutare as a guest of Government when the province hosted the Zimbabwe National Youth Games some years back, said he is thrilled to take his act to Manicaland. “I love Mutare particularly for its hospitable people and the tourist attractions. But for me it is always business first. That “The Guy” has challenged me is testimony to his bravery. “I have followed his boxing journey and have to admit that he has what it takes to get to the top. I am in camp preparing for the Mutare tour of duty and I promise the fans the best of ‘The Busy Bee’,” he said. The developments come at a time when Motsi is on cloud nine after scoping a silver medal at the Mandela Cup competitions which took place in Durban, South Africa, recently.   "

In front of a passionate home crowd hoping to see the five-time champion conjure a fairy-tale run deep into the second week in what is expected to be his last appearance at the event, 30th seed Lehecka spoiled the party with a 7-5 6-4 victory in just over two hours. Immediately after the match Nadal said farewell to fans in an on-court interview as the tournament unfurled five banners marking each of his five victories in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2017. “This is one of those days that when it arrives, it’s very tough, but life and my body have been sending me signals for a long time,” he said. “The dream was to finish here on court. I have been fortunate in my life to turn my passion into my job, I am privileged.” The 22-time Grand Slam champion arrived in Madrid saying he wasn’t fully fit and was worried about his condition, but in the end was celebrating having won three consecutive matches without showing significant physical limitations. Nadal had only one break opportunity against the big-serving Lehecka who has now won all of his three matches in straight sets. “It’s amazing to share a court with such a legendary player. It’s a dream come true; I always wished for this to happen,” Lehecka said. “I’m very grateful to achieve such a big moment and all the best to Rafa. It’s kind of bittersweet to have such a nice win in front of all these people who were cheering for him. The energy was amazing.” Alcaraz battles past dogged Struff Carlos Alcaraz was pushed to the limit, but found the answers when needed to overcome a gutsy Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-4) in a repeat of last year’s final. The 20-year-old is aiming to become the first player in history to win three straight titles at the ATP Masters 1000 event. “Honestly this match reminds me of last year’s match,” Alcaraz said. “It was pretty difficult from the first point until the last one. It was a great fight and it was difficult. It was difficult for me to deal with my emotions, to handle certain moments, difficult moments in the match. “Serving for the match, it was really difficult for me after that 40-0 up, but really happy that at the end it didn’t affect me with my game, with my mentality. I kept fighting. That’s all that matters and I’m really happy to get the win at the end.” “What a great battle,” Andy Murray’s former coach Miles Maclagan said on Sky Sports Tennis. “The style of game they play and the contest – nothing but respect for Jan-Lennard Struff. “For all that effort there’s no reward in the end but perhaps he’ll take a lot of heart in the way he’s played, the way he’s pushed Alcaraz, the way he’s continued to show resilience and character when I’m sure most would have been writing Alcaraz’s name into the next round. “He kept coming and kept coming and never got down on himself. That is one of his big attributes. This guy’s bag of tricks is a large one. “The power he brings, the athleticism, the punch as well.”— Supersport.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/how-much-is-manchester-uniteds-squad-worth/,How much is Manchester United’s squad worth?,"The ManicaPost   MANCHESTER United have put almost all of their squad up for sale as they look to refresh the team and generate funds under new co-owner Ineos.   United have spent about £1bn assembling their current squad over the past few years, but have endured a disappointing season under Erik ten Hag. Given they will miss out on Champions League football next year they will need to maximise player sales in order to spend – something BBC Sport’s chief football news writer Simon Stone says they have been “poor at in the past”. United’s most recent accounts show a total wage bill of £331m and an average weekly wage for players of £154,000 – both the fourth-highest totals behind Man City, Chelsea and Liverpool. So what is the value of their squad?   As ever with football transfers, it depends on who crunches the numbers. BBC Sport worked with two respected football data and research providers CIES Football Observatory, external and Transfermarkt, external to calculate the approximate market value of United’s players.   In comparison, Transfermarkt’s ‘market valuation’ is much more modest, and their UK content lead Stefan Bienkowski says it considers factors such as form, age, contract status and its own members’ evaluations. Transfermarkt says three of the top five biggest downgrades in market value, external in the Premier League this season are United’s Antony, Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount.
Here are their valuations: Marcus Rashford (26) “After reaching a career high of £73m in December 2021, Marcus Rashford’s market value has been steadily decreasing since then. It did jump back up to £68m around March of last year, but poor performances have seen his market value drop to where it now stands at £51m.” Antony (24)   “With a market value of £30m prior to his 95m euros (£81.3m) move to Man Utd, our data suggests Man Utd significantly overpaid for the Brazilian winger.   We did adjust the player’s market value to £64m following the move, but his consistently poor performances have seen it tumble back down even lower to £24m.” Jadon Sancho (24)   “Sancho was once one of the most valuable players in the world, when he had a market value of £112m in 2020.   But following his move to Man Utd, his market value has dropped from £77m to £21m following a lack of game time or good performances.   A return to form for Dortmund may interest some potential bidders and his market value will likely rise before the end of the season.” Bruno Fernandes (29)

“The Portuguese midfielder remains one of Man Utd’s few consistent stars, which is why he is currently their most valuable player at £60m.   But with his 30th birthday coming later in the year and his attacking stats slowing down compared to his first few years at Old Trafford, Fernandes’ market value has begun to creep downwards from a high of £77m.   It seems extremely unlikely any club would be willing to pay more than £60m this summer, should the midfielder demand a move from Old Trafford.” Andre Onana (28)

“Signed for 55m euros (£47.5m at the time), Onana had a difficult start to life at Man Utd. Although £34m may seem quite low for a goalkeeper, Onana is the second most valuable shot-stopper in the world.   No club has spent more than 50m euros (£43m) on a keeper since 2018.” Harry Maguire (31)

“Following his record £80m move from Leicester City, Maguire had a career-high Transfermarkt market value of £60m. But over the course of the past five years he has struggled for consistency and has perhaps been the most glaring example of Man Utd overpaying for players.   Aged 31 and with his contract expiring at the end of next season, a market value of £17m for the England centre-half seems fitting.” Scott McTominay (27) “The Scotland international has been a useful player in Erik ten Hag’s team and has seen his market value rise from £27m this season.   Man Utd have never sold a central midfielder for more than about £30m and it seems unlikely McTominay will push that figure much higher.” Diogo Dalot (25) “Signed for £19m, Dalot has seen his market value steadily rise to £30m since he joined the club back in 2018.   This makes him Transfermarkt’s eighth-most valuable player at Old Trafford and our eighth-most valuable right-back in the world.” — BBCsports.   "

Senior Reporter   THE ZIFA Eastern Region Division One Soccer League never ceases to amaze!   GrayHam FC – the club that was at the centre of the ZIFA Eastern Region Division One Soccer League’s Bikita Minerals and Tenax Premiership promotion boardroom drama – has been ‘relegated’ after only three matches in the 2024 season of the second tier league.   According to a communique from the football regional administration body, dated May 2, 2024, and signed by administrator, Fungai Munyoro-Chingaira, GrayHam were relegated for failing to pay in time fines emanating from the Premiership promotion case.   Interestingly, the letter notes that the Eastern Region Division One is currently in the spotlight for not following the rules and regulations.   “Take note of our professional interest herein. We, hereby, advise that you have been relegated from Eastern Region Soccer League with immediate effect as a result of failure to comply with the ruling of the Disciplinary Committee of March 18, 2024.   “Eastern Region is currently in the spotlight for not following the rules and regulations (sic) ref the landmark ruling at the beginning of the season 2024. As a result, Eastern Region has no choice but to follow recommendations from the Disciplinary Committee’s ruling.   “You have been given enough time to make good your fines (sic) but that time has lapsed twice before even a cent was paid. Eastern Region has been asked to observe the rules and regulations and recommendations from the Disciplinary Committee as there are (sic),” reads the ERSL statement.   When contacted for comment, GrayHam FC owner, Gray Hama said: “I am sponsoring football and someone is defeating the cause. That is all I can say.”   Although the use of the word ‘relegated’ is not appropriate, it can easily be construed as expulsion of the club from the league for failing to pay a stipulated fine after a hearing.   This publication understands that after the decisions of the Eastern Region Soccer League self-appointed kangaroo court that set and fined GrayHam FC US$2 500 were reversed by the ZIFA Normalisation Committee, a Disciplinary Committee that subsequently presided over the same matter then imposed a US$4 500 fine on GrayHam FC.   GrayHam FC appealed against the outcome, but the club found no respite after ZIFA requested for US$5 000 appeal fee, which the club failed to raise and were told that their appeal period had lapsed.   Thereafter, the ZIFA Eastern Region Soccer League started giving notices of demanding the US$4 500 payment from the club.   GrayHam FC wrote to the Eastern Region Soccer League asking for a payment plan, which was denied.   Nonetheless, the expulsion of the Ruwa-based GrayHam FC, two days before the regional football body’s Annual General Meeting, smacks of victimisation of a perceived maverick competitor.   The outspoken Hama has made clear his intentions to contest for the Eastern Region Soccer League leadership position.   "

Post Reporter IN a shocking show of brutality, an unknown assailant allegedly mugged and fatally stabbed a Buhera nurse at her doorstep, plunging the Nerutanga community into deep mourning recently. The incident happened in Mangwanya Village under Chief Nerutenga in Buhera. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka confirmed the brutal incident, and identified the defenceless victim as Ms Ivy Mangwanya (40), a nurse who was stationed at Nerutanga Clinic in Buhera. She was allegedly accosted and murdered on her doorstep as she returned from Masvingo. The suspect allegedly stabbed her with a sharp object, and left her to bleed to death as he vanished from the scene into the darkness with US$50. Assistant Inspector Chinyoka appealed to members of the public with information leading to the arrest of the suspect to contact their nearest police station. “I can confirm a tragic incident that occurred on April 28 in Mangwanya Village under Chief Nerutenga in Buhera, when a local nurse, Ms Ivy Mangwanya who had just arrived from Masvingo, was stabbed on the throat with a sharp object by an unknown assailant. The suspect snatched a Vodacom cellphone and bag containing various clothes and vanished from the scene, leaving the victim to bleed to death,” he said. Assistant Inspector Chinyoka said Ms Mangwanya lost a lot of blood as she screamed for help. She later got late help from one Zivanai from the same village, who rushed to the scene and found her gasping for air. Ms Mangwanya died before Zivanai could rush her to hospital.   A report was made at ZRP Buhera and police attended the scene. “A bag, suspected to be the one that had been stolen from Ms Magwanya was recovered with some clothes. The deceased’s body was taken to Murambinda Mission Hospital for a post-mortem. The suspect is still at large, and we are appealing to the public with information pertaining to the whereabouts of the unknown suspect to report to any nearest police station,” said Assistant Inspector Chinyoka.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/church-clerk-up-for-12-000-fraud/,Church clerk up for $12 000 fraud,"The ManicaPost   Post Correspondent THE United Methodist Church in Rusape was prejudiced of over US$12 000 by its accounts clerk who allegedly took advantage of laxity in controls to forge receipts and manipulate amounts paid by different assemblies for five months. The church’s accounts clerk — Miriam Chibvura (44), of Silverbow, Rusape, was recently arrested and arraigned before the courts to answer theft charges as defined in Section 113 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23. She allegedly siphoned more than US$12 000 from the church’s coffers through forging receipts between March 1, 2023 and August 31, 2023. Chibvura, who is being represented by Mr Munyaradzi Manyengavana, of Manyengavana Law Chambers, was not asked to plead when she appeared before Rusape magistrate, Mr Tapiwa Kuhudzayi last week. She was remanded out of custody on her cognisant (free bail). Ms Belinda Chari prosecuted. Ms Chari said Chibvura would receive varying amounts of money from the churches under Makoni-Buhera District, and issued out correct receipts, but would later create other receipts with lesser amounts. The offence came to light when she presented two receipts books with different payments, prompting senior members of the church to institute an audit. “On an unknown date, but during the period extending March 1, 2023 to August 31, 2023, the accused person hatched a plan to steal from her employer. She received different amounts of cash from the United Methodist churches in and around Rusape and issued out receipts. The receipts issued were a confirmation of cash received from the churches. However, Chibvura converted cash amounting to US$12 333 to her own use. “The accused person destroyed the receipts books with copies she had issued to the churches. She took another unused receipt book and re-receipted the cash she had received from churches, plucking out receipts, and at the same time destroying the original receipts. The fake receipt book running from DY400 to DY600 are held as exhibit. “Chibvura later compiled two different financial statements using statistics from the doctored receipt books and submitted them for presentation at financial meetings held in September and November 2023, respectively. “She was asked to produce the receipts books, and only managed to furnish two receipt books of which one of them was fake. Of the two receipts books, one was purported to have been used to receipt United States dollars (USD), while the other one was for ZWL dollars,” said Ms Chari. Ms Chari said an alert board member of the trustee, Mr Edward Mukoyi and church members conducted an audit comparing the income, which was US$43 072 against the expenditure of US$31 639, and discovered an unaccounted variance of US$12 333. When questioned about the difference, Chibvura failed to account for it resulting in a police report being made. “The original receipts issued by Chibvura to churches were re-collected by the informant from the churches. The fake receipts will be produced in court as exhibits. The total value stolen is US$12 333 and nothing was recovered,” said Ms Chari.   "

Weekender Reporter A DEVASTATED Mutare woman has approached the court seeking an order barring her possessive ex-husband, Bornface Zvawashe from pressurising her into reconciling with him. Stung by Kunashe Mare’s incessant rejection, Zvawashe allegedly demanded a refund of the bride price he paid to her family during the subsistence of their marriage. This is seen as part of the broader strategy to pressurise Mare to reconcile with him at all costs, prompting her to approach Mutare Civil Court for a protection order. The two appeared before Mutare magistrate, Mr Xavier Chipato who granted the protection order which is valid for the next five years. “Your worship, we separated in 2011, and since then he has been a constant source of distress in my life. He has resorted to physical violence and verbal abuse to intimidate me. He always says that we should reconcile and threatens that if we do not get back together, he will demand his bride price back from my parents,” she said. Mare added that Zvawashe texts and insults her over the phone. “Recently he sent me a text message insulting me and my parents, saying my parents did not raise me well because I left my matrimonial home. That is not true. “He was unfaithful to the extent of proposing love to my sister to be his side chick. I did not say anything though I realised at that moment that he does not deserve me. As we speak, this man has two wives, but still bothers me. I am scared because I am now employed as a domestic worker, and if he comes to my workplace and cause commotion, I might lose my job,” she said. Responding to the allegations, Zvawashe was not ashamed of his aggressive behaviour. He admitted harassing Mare, saying he wanted her back as a wife. “I am not denying that I went to her place and caused havoc. I did that out of love. I love her, but she does not want to submit to my terms and conditions. She tells people our family secrets, a reason why at one point I sent her an insulting text message.   She had no right to talk about my family issues to people, it is my private life after all.   I have two wives, but I love her more than them, yet she no longer wants to warm my bed.   “I even suggested consulting her aunts, but every time I meet them we never come to an agreement. They no longer want me as their son in-law. I cannot completely turn my back on her as we have two children together. “I asked for the bride price refund because her uncles do not give me a listening ear, which really eats my heart,” he said. Mr Chipato advised the two to come to a reasonable understanding so that Zvawashe can have access to their children.   "

Senior Reporter   THREE senior police officers from the Asset Forfeiture Unit in Harare who were arrested for allegedly digging a Nyanyadzi homestead in search of an undisclosed hidden treasure were this week acquitted by the courts.   The trio — Shepherd Tachiona (50) (Detective Superintendent) of Dawnview Park, Harare; Mkhululi Nyoni (51) (Detective Chief Inspector) of Manyame Park, Chitungwiza and Monica Madzima (Detective Inspector) of Chipukutu Park, Ruwa — who are attached to the Asset and Forfeiture Unit, CID Headquarters in Harare, — were acquitted at the close of the State case on Tuesday.   The defence, comprising Messrs Musindo Hungwe and James Nemaisa of M.D Hungwe Attorneys at Law, made an application and the State, which was represented by Mr Tirivanhu Mutyasira conceded that it had failed to prove a prima facie case to warrant the accused trio to be put on their defence.   Initially, the trio spent three nights in custody following their arrest in December last year on criminal abuse of duty as a public officer charges as defined in Section 174 (1) (a) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23.   Upon their initial court appearance, they were remanded out of custody to January 1, 2024 on US$50 bail each.   It was alleged that the accused persons, in the exercise of their functions as public officers, intentionally dug the homestead yard of Ms Simangaliso Memory Mushaya in search of a treasure allegedly hidden underground without authority from their principal as well as engagement of other relevant Government experts, for the purpose of showing disfavour to the State; a conduct which is contrary to or inconsistent with their duty as public officers.   The court heard that on December 22, Tachiona, Nyoni and Madzima proceeded to Nyanyadzi Irrigation Scheme in search of a treasure allegedly hidden underground there.   “Upon arrival in Nyanyadzi, they approached the house owner, Ms Simangaliso Memory Mushaya armed with a warrant of search and seizure issued on October 18, 2023 at Chipinge Magistrates’ Court by the resident magistrate, Mr Mkwananzi (Franklyn). They informed the house owner that they intended to dig her homestead’s yard in search of the hidden treasure,” said Mr Mutyasira.   The owner of the homestead allegedly complied with the given instruction.   “In pursuit of their mission, the accused persons had not advised their principal before embarking on the mission as is the norm. Further, they had not engaged other relevant Government departments for their expert services. Instead, they had sought the services of one structural surveyor, Victor Mukungunugwa employed by Zimbabwe National Geospatial and Space Agency whom they intended to pay for his services in their personal capacity.   “They had also sought the services of a prophet, Revesai Matimba, who claims to have spiritual powers to detect precious minerals,” said Mr Mutyasira.   It is alleged that the accused persons were later intercepted by the police in the midst of digging in search of the alleged hidden treasure on Christmas Day.   "

Weekender Reporter A CHIPINGE man last Friday caused a stir as he roamed the streets of Mutare with a puff adder and crabs in a transparent plastic bag. He was later arrested and fined for criminal nuisance. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka said Learnmore Mayengamhuru, of Muruweru Village, under Chief Musikavanhu in Chipinge, was charged with criminal nuisance as defined in Section 46 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9: 23. “He was arrested after being found in possession of a dead puff adder and crabs in the central business district (CBD) of Mutare. Police details escorted him to Mutare Central Police Station where he was fined for criminal nuisance. He was released after paying a fine,” he said, adding that the dead reptile and crabs were handed over to Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority. “The snake and crabs were in their early stages of decomposition, and therefore were disposed of. Mayengamhuru, however, did not say how he got the dead creatures,” he said. The unusual find, drew a large crowd, with curious onlookers following the man, who was being accompanied by two cycling cops to Mutare Central Police Station. The superstitious among them labelled Mayenganhuru a ritualist. They argued that he wanted to use the snake for money making rituals. However, Mayengamhuru maintained his cool and never answered back as he stood guarded by the police officers. A vendor, Tambudzai Maringosi who was among the first to discover that Mayengamhuru was carrying a dead snake in a plastic bag, said they were shocked to see the man walking freely on the pavements with his “parcel”. “He was walking in the city’s downtown area when we saw that he was carrying a snake in a plastic bag. We did not know whether the snake was dead or alive, but it looked alive at that point. “Someone shouted that he was carrying a snake, and he was suddenly mobbed as people rushed to catch a glimpse of him. “Some wanted to administer instant justice on him, but luckily there were two police officers on patrol nearby, who apprehended and took him to Mutare Central Police Station,” she said. Another onlooker, Chipo Ratidzanwa said they nearly beat the man on suspicions of being a ritualist. “People wanted to beat him, but they were afraid that the snake might react and attack them. It was upon arrival at Mutare Central Police Station when it was discovered that the snake was dead. “All along people thought that it was alive. He was very lucky because the police did not take time to arrive and escort him, otherwise people wanted to beat him up believing that he was a ritualist,” she said.   "

Tendai Munyusa told the court that she has been solely shouldering the responsibilities of raising their two kids on her own. The case underscores the difficult circumstances facing many young women, particularly those lacking adequate support from their partners.   The two appeared before Mutare magistrate, Ms Purity Gumbo, who ordered Gwinyi to pay US$50 towards the upkeep of the two children. “Your Worship, I humbly seek your intervention in my current predicament. Despite my parents’ generous support, the financial burden of caring for my two children has become overwhelming. “ In light of my parents’ recent need to prioritise my siblings’ schooling, I have been left without assistance for some time. “I am now requesting a monthly maintenance payment of US$100 from my ex-husband, Gwinyi, who earns US$250 from his current employment. “This amount is modest and represents a fair share of his income, considering that he also has other children to support. I knew our love was never meant to be, but I never thought he will turn his back on his own children. “He has never shown any interest in their wellbeing, and it breaks my heart. From the moment I gave birth, he has been completely disengaged, oblivious to their ages and the simple joys of parenthood. “ To think that he could forsake his own flesh and blood is truly unfathomable,” she said. Gwinyi denied the assertions, arguing that he has been assisting the children whenever he could. “Your worship, I refute the claims that I have completely neglected my children. “While it may be true that I am not aware of their precise ages, that does not reflect lack of care or involvement in their lives. To the contrary, I provide assistance when I am financially able to do so. I have on numerous occasions purchased food and other essentials for my children, and my ex-wife’s grandmother can attest to this fact. “I am not employed on a permanent basis and earn approximately US$7 per day through part-time work, and I am therefore offering a maintenance payment of US$30 per month,” he said.   Ms Gumbo ordered him to contribute US$50 for the two children’s upkeep.   "

The two appeared before Mutare magistrate, Ms Purity Gumbo who refused to grant the protection order. “Your Worship, my ex-husband and I have been separated for two years. Three weeks ago, he violently assaulted me after discovering a message in my cellphone. The abuse he inflicted on me was so vicious. “Even during the course of our marriage, his tendency towards violence was a constant source of fear and distress. I cannot continue to live with the threat of his unpredictable and dangerous behaviour. I am here today to seek protection from the court against his relentless aggression,” she said. Makarawo further alleged that she was staying with her parents together with their two children “For our safety, I went back to my parents’ house in Gimboki. Leaving my children in his care was simply not an option, given his volatility and propensity for violence. My parents, too, have made it clear that they are fed up with him. He last assaulted me when I was out running a simple errand to get groceries for my family. The abuse has left me feeling terrified and vulnerable, with nowhere else to turn, but the court,” she said. Responding to the allegations, Matidza argued that the two are still together under the same roof even though they had formally separated. “Your worship, I oppose this application for a protection order because my ex-wife and I are still in a relationship. She visits my house frequently, even today she was there. While I acknowledge that I assaulted her in the past, but it was not in public like she said. She had come to my house when I saw messages from her ex-boyfriend. I apologised for my behaviour and I am committed to changing my ways. “I believe that my ex-wife is using this court process as a way of hiding the fact that we are still together from her parents. They no longer approve our relationship,” he said. Ms Gumbo sternly warned Makarawo against abusing the court process to suit her needs, and threw out her application. “It appears to me that you are attempting to manipulate the court process to suit your own needs. You say that you are still in a relationship with your ex-husband, yet you are seeking a protection order against him. “You claimed that he assaulted you, but you continue to visit his house. I think it is quite possible that your actions are motivated by your desire to keep your relationship with your ex-husband hidden from your family,” she said as she turned down the application.   "

We fought and she also inflicted a scar on me. “Your worship, we are just two siblings, but she does not respect me as her elder brother. She harasses my tenants and I end up retaliating on her own tenants. Many of my tenants have left because of her behaviour and what she says to them,” said Justine. Mr Chipato advised the siblings to stay in union as a family. “You are siblings, and the only close family members. I urge you to maintain peace and develop agape love towards one another,” said Mr Chipato.   "

Calisto Mashava (34), of Bairo Mugoriyondo, Machipanda, Mozambique and Moses Machipanda (34), of Bairo Chicueia, Machipanda, Mozambique, recently appeared before Mutare provincial magistrate, Mr Tendai Mahwe and pleaded guilty to the offence, and were each sentenced to an effective 10 years in jail. Miss Tinotenda Muzondo prosecuted. The court heard that on April 15, at around 4pm, the two skipped the border through an undesignated entry point near Marymount Teachers’ College in Mutare. They proceeded to Green Valley Farm, Odzi where they stayed at the shops until sunset. Miss Muzondo said on the same day around 9pm, the two proceeded to Green Valley Farm grapes fields. Upon arrival, they got to a ZESA power line and disconnected electricity from the power line using a metal object tied with a rope. They went to the transformer in the fields and cut its electric cables. The court also heard that on the same evening, an informant who is the foreman noticed that there was a power cut at the farm, but thought it was due to load-shedding. He decided to go to the grapes fields to check on the progress. Upon arrival at the fields, he saw the two accused persons at the transformer. He called for backup from the security personnel at the farm. They teamed up and approached the two Mozambican nationals. Upon realising that they had been spotted, the Mozambican duo fled into different directions, but Mashava was apprehended. Machipanda disappeared into the darkness to an unknown destination. Mashava was handed over to ZRP Odzi where he was detained. The next day, Mashava was handed over to CID Minerals Flora and Fauna Mutare for further management. He was interviewed and detectives took his phone and used it to contact Machipanda. Machipanda informed Mashava that he had escaped to Mutare and was waiting for him at the Victoria Chitepo Provincial Hospital Bus Stop. Mashava led the detectives to the bus stop and Machipanda was subsequently arrested. A search was carried out on in the satchel that Machipanda was carrying leading to the recovery of a 15-metres long blue rope tied with a metal deformed ring at one end, a hacksaw, two hacksaw blades, a cutter, knife, thread tape and three empty 50kg bags.
The total value stolen is US$1 000 and all was recovered. The recovered ZESA equipment is to be returned to the institution, while the implements used to commit the offence were forfeited to the State. On April 17, the Department of Immigration was advised of the arrest of the accused persons. The accused were issued with warrants for detention issued in terms of Section 10 of the Immigration Act 1979. The accused persons were also issued with warrants for further detention issued in terms of Section 8 (2) (b) of the Immigration Act 1979. The Department of Immigration also issued the magistrate with certificates of evidence in terms of Section 40 (1) of the Immigration Act (Chapter 4:02). Upon completion of serving their sentence, the two accused persons are to be handed over to the Department of Immigration for deportation. In a separate, yet similar case of theft of public infrastructure, a Rusape man who endangered the lives of railway travellers by stealing track signal poles was recently slapped with a 10-year jail term by a local magistrate. Farai Moyo was convicted of contravening the Railways Act, and sentenced to an effective 10 years in jail. He had pleaded not guilty when he appeared before Rusape magistrate, Mrs Barbara Mateko. Ms Event Dhliwayo prosecuted. She said on August 4, last year, Moyo together with Never Kasasa, a man only known as Baba Rudo and Forward Isaac Marambanyika, connived to steal NRZ signal poles along the railway line that links Headlands and Bardley.
All of Moyo’s accomplices are still at large. “The four uprooted the signal poles and left them hidden in a bush along the railway line. A patrol officer on duty noticed that the poles had been removed and found them hidden in a nearby bush. He informed his superior who reported the matter to the police,” said Ms Dhliwayo. The patrol officer and another NRZ employee were joined by police officers and they set up an ambush at the crime scene. “Two days later, and at around 4am, Moyo and his accomplices arrived at the scene driving a five-tonne truck. Kasasa who was driving, parked the vehicle and switched off the lights. The other three started loading the signal poles into the truck. They were intercepted by the police. They ran away after warning shots were fired into the air. The police officers also shot the vehicle’s tyres and the suspects left it behind,” she said. After the police recovered the vehicle, they searched it, and found a wallet containing Kasasa’s particulars, and a satchel which contained two hacksaws, hacksaw blades, together with some clothes and shoes. Moyo was arrested the following day after was identified by the patrol officer during the ambush. The NRZ was prejudiced of property worth US$2 300 and all was recovered. In passing sentence, Mrs Mateko said the severity of the gang’s actions could not be understated.   "

Post Reporter A MUTARE woman residing in Cape Town, South Africa, is on the run after allegedly scalding her husband with cooking oil over money meant for her lobola. The two reportedly clashed over the money, leading to the tragic death of the husband, Mr Moses Mtukwa, who succumbed to injuries sustained in the attack at a Cape Town hospital last Thursday. Mr Mtukwa (41) was hospitalised for two weeks and was on life-support before passing on, according to his older brother, Mr Davison Mtukwa. In an interview with The Manica Post, Mr Davison Mtukwa said after Moreblessing Nyakunu (40) scalded his brother with cooking oil, she stole 31 000 Rand and US$800 that her husband was saving to pay her bride price and disappeared. “My brother died due to the serious injuries he sustained after being scalded with cooking oil. What hurts most is that Nyakunu did not inform us that our brother was in hospital. Instead, each time we called him or her, she would answer the calls and pretended as if everything was fine. Each time my sister who is also in South Africa called looking for Moses, Nyakunu would tell her that he (Moses) was at home, while she was at work,” he said.    Tinashe Nyakunu, brother to Moreblessing Davison said they only got to know that their brother was in hospital five days after his admission when a well-wisher who had rushed him to the hospital contacted their sister. “When my sister got there, she was immediately told by the hospital authorities that Moses was supposed to be put on life-support system, and we had to run around looking for money for him to receive medical attention. At that time, Moses was still talking, and he told our sister that he had 31 000 Rand and US$800 at home. He said the money was meant to pay for Nyakunu’s bride price. He once told me about his savings, and we were planning to visit the Nyakunu family to settle some of the lobola arrears,” he said. Davison said when their sister went to Moses’ home, it was deserted and the money was nowhere to be found as Nyakunu had fled with it. “My brother and Nyakunu had a child together while they were still staying in Bvirindi Village under Chief Zimunya back then. They, however, parted ways and we were surprised to hear that he was cohabiting with her when he migrated to South Africa. They both came back home and he paid part of the bride price for her. Up until now, we never heard of any altercation between them. They appeared the most perfect couple to us. We were shocked to hear of this tragedy. “My brother told our sister before he was put on life-support that Nyakunu had scalded him because she wanted to use the lobola money for something else. After scalding him, neighbours rushed him to the hospital. She disappeared with the money. Up to now, South African police are looking for her because she committed a heinous crime,” he said.   The family has in its possession WhatsApp messages and audios sent between the couple hours prior to the commission of the heinous crime. In the chats, Nyakunu stated that she wanted to use the money for something else, and Moses had to give it to her, and look for the lobola money later. The Mutukwa family is now appealing to well-wishers to help them raise 17 000 Rand required for the repatriation of the deceased’s body for burial. “27 000 Rand is what is needed in total, and as a family we have managed to raise 10 000 Rand. Had she not stolen the money, we would have been able to bring back home our loved one, and lay him to his final resting place. We are unable to do that at the moment. We are appealing to Zimbabwe, family and friends to help us so that our brother’s remains are brought home,” said the man. Efforts to contact Moreblessing Nyakunu on WhatsApp were fruitless as her phone was unreachable. When The Manica Post visited the Nyakunu homestead in Bvirindi Village on Tuesday afternoon, Moreblessing’s mother, Mrs Loveness Nyakunu and her two sisters were struggling to come to terms with the tragedy.    Mbuya Loveness Nyakunu, mother to Moreblessing Mrs Nyakunu described her daughter as a moody and violent person. “I do not want to lie, Moreblessing is a violent person and always clashed with her sisters, but we never thought that things would come to this. We never thought she would murder her husband and I was shocked when I heard of this sad development. I passed out and had to be rushed to the clinic where I was resuscitated,” said the elderly woman.
She said they approached the Mtukwa family on Monday to extend their condolences. “When my daughter last called me, she said she had an altercation with her husband and he was admitted in hospital. Since then, her phones have been off and we cannot reach her. What she has done has left us in a big mess. I do not know how we will be able to raise the money that the Mtukwa family wants for the body to be repatriated to Zimbabwe,” she said amid sobs. Moreblessing’s brother, Mr Tinashe Nyakunu said they are also looking for her. “Moreblessing should come out of hiding and face the music. Yes, she erred, but she is still our sibling. She should surrender herself to the authorities so that the world knows the truth,” he said. He also appealed to well-wishers to help them raise funds to repatriate Moses’ body. For assistance, Mr Davison Mtukwa can be contacted on +263774411748.   Those willing to help with cash can also send money to his EcoCash US$ account on that sme number.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/minerals-leakage-elephant-in-the-room/,Minerals leakage: Elephant in the room,"The ManicaPost   Ray Bande
Senior Reporter OLD age think-tanks once wrote that looters don’t read, and readers don’t loot, but the unabated and alarming rate of mineral leakages, especially diamonds, lithium and gold, across the country and Manicaland in particular, is just too difficult to ignore. Ideally, mineral leakages are predominantly in the gold sub-sector and other precious and semi-precious stones like diamonds through smuggling and diversion to the informal market.   Experts estimate that the country could be losing billions of United States of America dollars annually through leakages. In the gold and lithium sub-sectors, of late, there have been reports of smuggling of minerals to countries such as South Africa, Dubai and China. Diamonds, for example, after being stolen from companies operating in the nearby Marange area, find a ready market in several buyers of foreign origin resident in some of Mutare’s leafy suburbs. A check by The Manica Post revealed that several foreign nationals, some with tertiary student status permits to justify their presence in the country, have set base in suburbs like Murambi, Morningside, Greenside and Fairbridge Park.   Gold buyers have also thronged Penhalonga area near Mutare where the mineral is sold in piecemeal to Fidelity Printers — the formal trend — but a considerable amount is reportedly being smuggled out of the country. In addition, it has also been reported that semi-precious stones discovered in some parts of the country like Hurungwe and Karoi in Mashonaland West Province where villagers extracted the stones without going through the normal processes that ensure Zimbabwe benefits as a nation, are allegedly smuggling the minerals. In an interview on the sidelines of the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development two-day workshop in Vumba last week, chairman of the Portfolio Committee, Honourable Joseph Msipa said they are seized with the matter of minerals leakage. “We are indeed concerned about the leakage of minerals as a committee. This is the reason why we will soon be calling for an indaba where we will bring together relevant stakeholders so that we map the way forward as a team. We are putting forward our suggestion as a committee to see the improvement of security on minerals in the country, and we hope we will achieve what we aspire to,” said the Shurugwi North parliamentarian. In a separate interview, speaking from a mining employees representative view, tough talking Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Union (ZFTU) secretary general, Cde Kennias Shamuyarira, said: “We have a well-orchestrated mafia extractive syndicate, right from some unscrupulous Government officials, colluding with the so-called investors at the expense of the working class and the majority citizenry. “Real economic development in a country can only be realised when we have radical policies on beneficiation and value addition to all our minerals and other natural resources.”   After extraction, gemstones such as amethyst, aquamarine, and garnet are illegally sold to unscrupulous dealers who smuggle and export the semi-precious and coloured stones in their raw form.   Cde Shamuyarira added: “I think we need to be very frank and candid to each other as a country and as a people. The whole issue starts from the investor, who comes into our space here in Zimbabwe, coming to invest in diamond, platinum or gold mining. “All the other countries that developed or are on the development path, they (investors) go there fully aware that they will put something and get something out of their initiative, and the people in the country they will be investing in, will also get something. “But our situation is so absurd. It is very skewed in the sense that you take a company like the now defunct Mbada Diamonds, they came with their machinery and expertise and all that we benefitted was employment of general hand workers. “Over and above that, there was no beneficiation. You cannot talk of beneficiation by a company of that magnitude when they built houses for displaced villagers. That was a prerequisite just like protective clothing for employees.”   Cde Shamuyarira said beneficiation should be noticed from the production of the end products, and not export of raw minerals as a way of also addressing rampant leakages of mineral. “The diamond was mined and is being mined, but there is no beneficiation. We should be having a polishing site where we employ people. After polishing diamonds, we must have the end product of rings, bracelets and so on. “That is what we call beneficiation, and once we have that we can curb leakages. “These diamonds are taken raw as they are to other people who know how to beneficiate our resources. This is why our theme for Workers Day this year touches on confronting extractive and parasitic investment. “These are the kinds of investments we are talking about whereby the country itself does not benefit and the employees do not benefit at all. You look at the salaries that people are being paid in these mines, it’s a pittance, save for the few middle management that serve the interest of the shareholders. “The rest are being paid amounts under the Poverty Datum Line and are wallowing in abject poverty, without any healthcare and education benefits. Overal, we do not see us as a country benefiting anything from these investments, simply because we do not have the end product being produced here,” he said. The gathering in Vumba was meant to establish a strong foundation for collaboration between MMCZ and the Parliamentary Committee, while equipping participants with a comprehensive understanding of the MMCZ’s mandate, strategic direction, and current operations. MMCZ was established to monitor and promote the export of all minerals produced in Zimbabwe with the exception of gold and silver which are dealt with by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.   Zimbabwe has 60 different mineral products, half of them currently being exported, but the country has been losing revenue from these minerals export owing to leakages at porous ports of exit such as Forbes Border Post in Mutare. While MMCZ has been monitoring movement of minerals from production site, with their inspectors operating within mineral producing sites, and partially through the export process, they have not been allowed to be stationed at the country’s ports of exit under the excuse that their presence would militate against ease of doing business. In their contribution during the MMCZ Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development workshop, a number of Members of Parliament emphasized the need to have MMCZ presence felt. Mutare North Member of the House of Assembly Cde Admire Mahachi said. “There is need to have MMCZ present at the place where minerals are getting outside the country. This is their actual job. Their job is not primarily in the offices, but in the field and the border is one place where they have to ensure that the country is not losing anything though their presence,” he said. Headlands Member of House of Assembly, Cde Farai Mapfumo said the country must not sacrifice the God-given minerals on the altar of ease of doing business. “Yes, we need to be seen to be facilitating the ease of doing business. No one denies that. However, we should not be seen to be sacrificing the God-given minerals on the altar of ease of doing business. “There are ways that can certainly be worked out to ensure that we secure our minerals, while at the same time provide ease of doing business for our visitors or investors.
“MMCZ should be right at the border and given space to operate without necessarily hindering the smooth flow of business at a given border post,” he said. Ideally, minerals are a finite resource that needs to be utilised for the benefit of the nation when extracted. Apart from being finite, the international prices of minerals fluctuate, further buttressing the need to utilise extracted minerals when they still have value. For example, the acute down spiraling of tantalite prices on the international market has resulted in the sudden disappearance of both local and foreign mining investors who had invaded Buhera District. Fielding questions from Members of the House of Assembly during the Vumba workshop, MMCZ’s corporate’s marketing manager, Mr Gumisai Nenzou said: “There is a fluctuation of the prices of minerals that we actively market as MMCZ. For example, there was once a hype around tantalite mining in Buhera District here in Manicaland. The demand was spurred by cellphone manufacturing clients who needed the product. “We saw numerous tantalite mining bases being set up in Buhera, and at the time tantalite was going for US$1 200 per kilogramme. Today, the same product has drastically gone down to US$100 for the same weight. “Given the production costs and other mining related expenses, it might no longer make any business sense, hence the disappearance of those who were mining it in Buhera,” said Mr Nenzou.   "

Senior Reporter CRIMINAL gangs wielding machetes have resurfaced in Mutare, pouncing on unsuspecting residents especially in low density areas in the dead of the night — a few months after such cases had subsided. The Manica Post has learnt that a 38-year-old woman had the unwelcome visitors at her Murambi East home in the wee hours of Monday. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka, confirmed the incident, and said the victim, Ms Lucia Masiya was struck by a machete by two unknown assailants in her Murambi East house. “The incident happened on Monday around 3am in Murambi East, Mutare. The complainant, Ms Lucia Masiya (38) heard noise from her children’s room, and went to investigate. “She met two unknown men who struck her using the flat side of the machete before escaping with two cellphones, an Itel 516 Pro, Huawei Honor 5A and a 14-inch Keson television set. However, the television set was dropped on their way out of the premise,” he said. Assistant Inspector Chinyoka urged residents in leafy suburbs of Mutare to intensify security at their homes. He said the police have also increased patrols in the area. “We would like to urge residents in leafy suburbs of Mutare to intensify security around their homes because indications are that machete gangs are back. “As the police, we are also increasing our presence in these suburbs. We are using our dog section, Ferret teams as well as motorised patrols,” he said. Assistant Inspector Chinyoka bemoaned the behaviour of some residents in these suburbs who deliberately leave their windows open. “It is sad that while we are trying to protect residents and their properties, we have noticed during patrols that some of them leave their windows open, while some gather outside their homes on account of hot weather,” he said.   "

Post Correspondent UNSUSPECTING people desperately seeking to travel to the Diaspora in search of greener pastures are falling victims to a syndicate of bogus travel agents that are swindling them of their hard earned money, and a suspect — Bridget Mugunha of Rusape — was arrested for fleecing a job seeker US$2 500. Magunha (26), of Tsanzaguru in Rusape, allegedly misled Bruce Gwangwara into believing that she had secured him a work permit at a company in Poland, and demanded US$2 500 for the said services. Magunha, who was represented by Mr Munyaradzi Manyengavana, of Manyengavana Law Chambers, was not asked to plead when she appeared before magistrate, Mrs Patience Chirimo, who granted her US$100 bail with reporting conditions. Prosecutor, Mr Takunda Muzenda said Magunha informed Gwangwara that she had sorted all his papers, and advised him to proceed to the Polish Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa where it emerged that the papers were counterfeit. “The accused is a self-styled travel agent based in Rusape, and on a date unknown to the prosecutor, but between November and December 2023, she misrepresented to Gwangwara that she could facilitate a work permit and travel documents for him to travel to Poland. “Magunha charged Gwangwara US$2 500 for the job. The accused took the US$2 500, and gave the complainant some documents purporting that it was a work permit for him to obtain a visa to travel to Poland. “Gwangwara travelled to the Polish Embassy in Pretoria in a bid to get the visa, only to be told that his documents were fake and his application was declined. “Copies of the alleged work permit with the particulars of a Polish employer and the name of the complainant as employee given to the complainant by the accused person is available as evidence. Value of the cash defrauded is US$2 500, and nothing was recovered,” said Mr Muzenda. The matter was adjourned to April 22 for trial.   "

Senior Reporter AGRICULTURAL activities across Manicaland have been the biggest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) earner for the province, with a total output of ZWL$8.42 billion, a realisation that is now influencing Government’s renewed value addition drive for produce from all the seven districts. Provincial GDP measures economic activity at provincial level to facilitate decision-making and policy evaluation. Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZimStat) produces provincial GDP estimates annually. In his presentation during the National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) engagement which brought together Government and the private sector, comprising captains of industry, academia, local authorities and business executives in Manicaland at a local hotel yesterday (Thursday), ZimStat’s manager (national accounts department), Mr Grown Chirongwe, said: “The 2022 value added for agriculture at constant prices (wholesaling and retailing) was estimated at ZWL$4.33 billion and ZWL$4.09 billion, respectively. “The value added for mining and manufacturing was estimated at ZWL$3.18 billion and ZWL$2.30 billion, respectively. Agriculture had the highest contribution (19.9 percent) to Manicaland Provincial GDP owing to vibrant forestry and horticultural activities (in Honde Valley, Nyanga, Chipinge and Chimanimani). Furthermore, the production of milk and fishing is also contributing much to the industry. “Wholesale and retailing activities accounted for 18.8 percent of the provincial GDP. Activity is mainly concentrated in Mutare, Rusape and Chipinge towns. “14.6 percent of the provincial GDP was generated from the mining industry. This was mainly driven by extraction activities in Chiadzwa (diamond), Penhalonga and Nyanga (gold) and Phosphate (dorowa). “Manufacturing recorded 10.5 percent, with much of the activity being witnessed in the manufacturing of groceries (Mega Market), timber products (Border Timbers, Wattle Company and Allied Timbers as the main players), oxygen manufacturing (Verify Engineering) and Delta Beverages (Rusape and Mutare).” In an interview on the sidelines of the NECF engagement, Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza said: “Manicaland is a land of milk and honey, but that honey needs to be tapped and value added. You will discover that in every district, we have got what it takes to establish factories or plants that can add value to the farm produce. “We are now geared to embark on an intensive value addition of all our agricultural produce in all the seven districts of Manicaland Province. “Already, we have macadamia crushing equipment that is now operational in Chipinge, but we feel we need much more, given the high levels of macadamia production that is going on in Chipinge. In Chimanimani, we have Allied Timbers’ state-of-the-art timber milling plant, and we have been approached by other investors that want to put up other plants there. “In Mutare, we have plants that are value adding baobab fruit. At Mutare Teachers’ College we have a plant that will soon be commissioned by His Excellency, President Mnangagwa that will produce Wasu Juice from the baobab fruit. “We have the same lined up for Honde Valley where we have many fruits and vegetables that are being produced, and plans are underway that we have a plant that will carry out drying and processing of these products. “The same applies for Nyanga where we have potatoes and apples. In Makoni, we have an investor who has approached us with the aim of having a tobacco processing plant. Instead of our farmers taking their produce to Harare, we are anticipating that soon they will be providing their produce to a local processing company.” In a separate interview, NECF Steering Committee co-chairperson, Dr Mike Bimha, said: “Zimbabwe is known for its intellectuals, and it is high time we transform this intellect into tangible development. “This is the gap that the NECF is geared to cover, and ensure that we develop as a nation, without any place and any person being left behind. This initiative is meant to allow provinces to take ownership in generating their own GDP.” NECF’s acting executive secretary, Mr Muzi Muzite said: “The Manicaland NEFC Development Dialogue is the first of a series of similar engagements that will take place across the country. The aim is to let all stakeholders give input into the GDP of the province up to national level, and ensure that every citizen plays a part in the development discourse of the country. “Ultimately, all the ideas will be factored into the national policy formulation, and that means whatever we get here and all other provinces will be factored into the National Development Strategy (NDS2), which is the next blueprint that the country will embark on as we journey towards Vision 2023, as espoused and instructed by our principal, President Mnangagwa.” The Manicaland Provincial Development Dialogue programme was held under the theme: “Towards inclusive socio-economic transformation: Leaving no one and no place behind.” The NECF is a public private dialogue convener established in July 1997 after lessons learnt during a trip to Malaysia by former President Mugabe where the delegation witnessed host Government, business, labour and civil society coming together to discuss issues of national importance in an unfettered environment. Since its establishment, the NECF played a crucial role in policy formation.   "

Post Correspondent GOVERNMENT in partnership with the Swedish Embassy, rolled out lucrative and inclusive commercial horticulture and mushroom economic projects in two districts, resulting in the creation of thousands of job, while fusing women and youths into well-meaning economic activities. The programme, funded to the tune of US$4. 6 million, is being administered by Gender Links Zimbabwe, and has two lucrative projects in Manicaland —which include a massive greenhouse at Masvosva, in Makoni West Constituency and a viable mushroom venture in Chikanga suburb of Mutare. In other parts of the country, funds were availed for waste management, clean energy and market facilities projects, which have overwhelmingly transformed beneficiaries’ livelihoods. Speaking at the commissioning the two Manicaland projects on Wednesday, Local Government and Public Works Minister, Honourable Daniel Garwe said the programme is in tandem with the country’s vision of creating an upper middle economy where all citizens lead decent lives. Minister Garwe said by promoting gender-inclusive local economic development, the initiative is creating a just and equitable society where everyone has an opportunity to succeed. “This transformative initiative marks a pivotal step towards reducing poverty and enhancing livelihoods through gender-responsive and inclusive local economic development in 12 centres of excellence for gender centres in local government. The vision for this programme is to create a society where women, youths and men have equal opportunities to contribute to and benefit from economic growth. “On November 1, 2023, President Mnangagwa launched the Local Authorities Blueprint on service delivery towards attainment of Vision 2030. “The blueprint is underpinned by the mantra: “Call to action — no compromise to service delivery”. It is therefore critical to underscore that local authorities as a third tier of Government are a critical stakeholder in achievement of an upper middle-income society by 2030. I am therefore highly elated that Makoni Rural District Council and Mutare City Council contributed towards the success of the Masvosva Greenhouse and Chikanga Mushroom projects respectively which resonates well with the “Call to action — no compromise to service delivery”. “We envision an upper middle income economy by 2030 with local authorities that are empowered to drive economic development that is inclusive, sustainable, and gender-responsive. “Through this programme, viable local economic development flagship enterprises have been established in 12 centres across the country. “These enterprises will serve as models of best practice, showcasing how gender responsive local economic development can drive economic growth and create meaningful opportunities for all. “In each of these 12 local authorities, we have invested in critical infrastructure projects that will support the development of the flagship enterprises. The total value of the project is US$4.6m over three years. The projects include the construction of horticulture infrastructure like greenhouses and mushroom houses. “Waste management facilities were also constructed and relevant equipment as well as clean energy facilities and markets were availed. “The programme will create jobs for 3 600 people in 12 local authorities and provide the much-needed income and improve the livelihoods of families and communities,” said Minister Garwe. Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza welcomed the projects, saying they have made significant impact to the Masvosva and Chikanga communities, addressing multi-faceted challenges. “The overall goal of the programme is to reduce poverty and enhance livelihoods through gender responsive and inclusivity. These initiatives, therefore represent the significant milestone in our commitment to fostering inclusive growth and empowering all members of our society. “The Masvosva Greenhouse and the Chikanga Mushroom House are multi-faceted projects which will assist the province to shoot several birds with one stone. We shall achieve Sustainable Development Goal Number 2 — zero to hunger and Number 5 — gender equality through the implementation of programmes such as these. “The growing and selling of horticultural produce and mushroom serve as a platform for promoting gender equality and empowerment and growing our economy as Manicaland,” he said. Gender Links regional director, Mrs Priscilla Maposa said her organisation poured in a significant amount of money for the projects and the involvement of Government, through local authorities, will make the projects self-sustaining. “For the Masvosva Horticulture Project, we availed US$178 000 — for the construction of the infrastructure, while the Chikanga Mushroom Project was supported with US$76 000. For sustainability, the programme is being implemented in partnership with Government and local authorities. “Councils will take over and run the projects together with communities, capacity building of council officials and beneficiaries is also key for the ownership of the programme. The beneficiaries have developed business plans and models which also outlines how the businesses will be run, flourish and remain in existence even when the funder has weaned off beneficiaries,” she said. Mrs Josephine Makumbe, the secretary of the Masvosva Horticulture Project, said the greenhouse facility has changed the face of the village and transformed their lives for the better. “We are a group of 50 women, youths and men commercially growing horticultural produce in the greenhouse. We have graduated from subsistence to commercial farming — a dream come true for us. The earnings are so encouraging, and we hope to penetrate bigger markets in Harare and Mutare,” said Mrs Makumbe.   "

I went there on a work-related visit, and when I wanted supper, I walked into a restaurant with my US$10. I slept on an empty stomach after they told me to bring their Zambian kwacha”. These were the words of inspiration from Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu while addressing business delegates in Mutare last week. As he answered questions from the delegates, Dr Mushayavanhu emphasised on the need to instil fiscal discipline to extricate the country out of the current economic quagmire.   Fiscal discipline dictates that governments maintain fiscal positions that are consistent with macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth. To this end, it warrants avoiding excessive borrowing and debt accumulation. Accordingly, money supply growth on the market is one pertinent thing that he promised to maintain during his tenure at the Central Bank. “It is an issue that we need to solve once and for all. Previously, our money supply was growing because of what we call quasi-fiscal operations. “Let me explain all this, in case some of you will look at it in bad light. The country was under sanctions and Government could not borrow in its own right. “Lenders who were at least willing to assist us as a country came up with a way to lend to the Central Bank. When you lend to the Central Bank, it is an entity that does not generate income, and the only way it could generate that income was by printing money. “So what would happen is that as those loans were being repaid, the Central Bank would buy foreign currency from the market and credit the exporters’ accounts with RTGS, which in itself is printing money. But it was all for the good of the country. “Most of you were saying they are seeing growth in the economy, yes, it was all because of that,” he said, hence the need to stop the printing of money forthwith. “The Central Bank has pushed some liabilities to treasury, and they are being serviced through tax collections, thereby reducing pressure on it and that is why we say there will be no more money printing, and we mean it,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu noted that some improvements are already happening in the economy. “There has been a lot of retooling. I was in Bulawayo last week. Belmont used to be an industrial hub just after independence. In the last 10 years all those industries had been converted into churches, but in the last three years, the buildings are becoming factories again. There is a lot happening there,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu also emphasised on the need to rebuild trust and confidence on the market. “There is need for policy consistency and restoration of trust and confidence. I am on record saying confidence and trust cannot be legislated. I cannot stand here and say trust me. The only being that you can trust is God. But what we can do best as the Central Bank is to walk the talk. “What we say we will do, we have to do it, and with time people will trust us. That is the journey we have embarked upon. We announced the Monetary Policy Statement on April 5, and have insisted that there will be no flip-flopping,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said to ensure policy consistency, the Central Bank has established a Monetary Policy Monitoring Committee that has come up with a dashboard that tracks every parameter mentioned in the Monetary Policy Statement. “The Monetary Policy Monitoring Committee is looking at it daily, to see if we are complying. It is either green, amber or red. If we are getting near the ceiling, warning bells start ringing and we will do something about it. “Over time you will then come to trust us. Once we perfect this dashboard, we will make it public so that on a month or weekly basis, we will be saying these are the parameters. “The committee will meet on a quarterly basis to take stock as to whether we are living up with the Monetary Policy Statement we would have announced,” he said. He allayed fears that the gold meant to back the new currency was not there. “We showed you the gold that we have because some of you thought that it was a very small portion. Manicaland is a gold producing province and I am sure some, if not all of you have tried to lift various amounts of gold. “In that vault, there is 1.5 tonnes of gold. Another one tonne is offshore and the difference of 250kg was in the form of other minerals like diamonds and so forth, waiting to be converted to gold value,” said Dr Mushayavanhu.   "

Post Correspondent ZIMBABWE has launched its first ever National Forest Policy in response to the climate change phenomenon and continued discretion of natural ecosystems by irresponsible people. The policy comes at a time when the province is facing serious environmental challenges threatening to exterminate some forests, especially in the tobacco growing hubs of Manicaland like Makoni and Mutare districts, which has witnessed the wanton destruction of forests by farmers to cure the golden leaf.   To make the situation worse, illegal settlers have moved into grazing land, national parks, plantations, riverbanks and wetlands, while illegal mining activities are exacerbating the environmental damage through land degradation, deforestation and chemical contamination of water sources. Veld fires continue posing severe threats to the conservation of biodiversity and human life, with newly resettled smallholder farmers perceived as major drivers. Wanton burning of vegetation means reduction in carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, and the smoke from the infernos produce huge amounts of carbon dioxide, which is the greenhouse gas causing global warming. Forests burning is a single largest contributor to greenhouse gases in the dry season. The infernos chew pastures, leaving land without vegetative cover and livestock without pastures, resulting in reduced returns to farmers due to poor beef quality, low milk production and poor market prices for the animals.   Regardless of promulgation of several laws aimed at preventing fires, the infernos remain a perennial problem. Manicaland is home to an assortment of natural rainforests, which must be protected from wanton deforestation for future generations to benefit from. The province commands massive timber plantations which provide lifeline to the timber industry and employing thousands of people.   Environment, Climate and Wildlife Minister, Dr Sithembiso Nyoni last week said trees and forests are an integral part of a production system that drives social and economic development. “Zimbabwe’s first National Forest Policy seeks to promote sustainable management of forests as a national heritage, through the provision of an enabling environment conducive for all the stakeholders involved in the forest resources management.   This cogent policy framework allows for effective participation to foster socio-economic development through sustainable management and utilisation of various goods and services that come from trees and forests. “The objective of the forest policy is to maximise the conversation and sustainable management of forests towards improved environmental protection. There are multiple benefits that locals derive from intensification of forest development in the context of non-timber forest products and reducing carbon emissions. The next decades, will place nature as a defence line against the vagaries of climate change,” said Minister Nyoni. She added: “The policy development adopted an inclusive approach informed by national stakeholders to design actions that are people centred in forest management. In line with Government’s vision of economic growth and sustainable development enshrined in the National Development Strategies and the 2030 National Vision, the National Forest Policy makes emphasis on promoting conversation and sustainable management of forests in all categories of forest tenure systems to enhance the forest resource base, ensure ecosystem stability and provision of basic environmental services.” Environmental activist and national trees ambassador, Mr Never Bonde said the afforestation and reforestation culture must be inculcated in the minds of citizens. “This policy comes at the right time when forests across the country are under siege from deforestation. In Manicaland, we are witnessing the rampant cutting down of indigenous trees, especially by tobacco farmers, while minute efforts are being made towards afforestation and reforestation. “Forests must be used sustainably, and it is every citizen’s role and responsibility to plant trees. We understand that the majority still use wood as a source of energy, but they should also plant trees. Let us stick to the ‘you cut one, plant two’ principle,” said Mr Bonde. Save the Environment and Climate Foundation Trust executive director, Mr Learnmore Nyaruwanga said the policy will get buy-in from stakeholders as it has direct benefits for communities.   “We believe this policy will go a long way in addressing forestry management issues. The concept of including orchards in forestry programmes is also vital, as they play a double effect by providing nutritious fruits, while being sinkers. Most communities will embrace this concept as it provides direct benefits to them.“Tobacco farmers and contractors must also be taken on board as they are negatively impacting on the forests,” said Mr Nyaruwanga.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/zig-meant-to-cushion-workers-minister/,ZiG meant to cushion workers: Minister,"The ManicaPost   Ray Bande 
Senior Reporter THE recent introduction of the new currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) was meant to cushion workers and retain the value of their wages, Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza has said. Minister Mugadza said this in his address at the Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions’ Workers Day commemorations held on Wednesday at Jopa Junction, in Chipinge. Workers’ Day is celebrated annually on May 1 as International Workers’ Day or May Day, to pay tribute to the historical struggle of workers and their trade unions for solidarity and fair employment standards.   This year’s global theme is: “Ensure Workplace Safety and Health Amidst Climate Change”. “The commemoration of Workers’ Day is a recognition of the key role of workers in socio-economic development. Thus, workers should be seen as a vital cog in the socio-economic transformative agenda as we journey towards sustainable economic growth. “Government is aware that this Workers’ Day is being commemorated at a time when the country is faced with economic challenges characterised by high levels of inflation that are constantly eroding workers’ income and negatively impacting on the livelihood of Zimbabweans. “This requires us to work together as Government, business and the workers. Government recently introduced new measures to tackle hyperinflation and currency depreciation. One significant move is the introduction of structured currency known as Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG). This initiative underscores our dedication to protecting the purchasing power of worker’s wages and salaries amidst rising inflationary pressures. By shielding workers from the adverse impact of inflation, Government wants to ensure that their earnings retain workers’ value and reliability, providing them with the much-needed assurance and stability,” Advocate Mugadza.   Speaking during the same function, Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions president, Mr Afred Makwarimba said: “Thorough consultation with the working class must be made in all economic activities in the country. The working class should not be used to rubber stamp neo-liberal policies. All economic policies should go through the Tripartite Negotiating Forum before being implemented. Workers are the vanguards of the economy. “Our economic policies must benefit the majority and not a tiny coterie of wealthy elites. Government should align itself with the workers. Workers are the real creators of the wealth.” In his address at the same function, Chief Director in the Ministry of Public Works, Labour and Social Welfare, Mr Clifford Matorera said Government respects workers’ rights and will do everything to honour them. “Government respects workers’ rights, and believe that their rights should be honoured. We want workers to get salaries that can cater for all their needs. This is the reason why Government introduced a new currency recently so that workers can get something tangible out of their efforts at work. We also implore employers to treat their employees fairly and this is the reason why we as Government are part of Workers’ Day commemorations,” he said.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/rbz-outlines-de-dollarisation-roadmap/,RBZ outlines de-dollarisation roadmap,"The ManicaPost   Ray Bande
Senior Reporter RESERVE Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu has expressed optimism that the country’s de-dollarisation thrust will succeed, amid projections that the foreign currency black market that is notorious for fuelling exchange rate volatility, inflation and macro-economic stability will gradually die before 2030. De-dollarisation is a process of moving away from the reliance on USD as the chief transacting currency to the newly introduced Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG). RBZ, a fortnight ago, unveiled ZiG as part of several policy measures to address exchange rate volatility, curtail inflation and restore macro-economic stability in the country. ZiG will circulate alongside a basket of other currencies, and the public has up to April 30 to convert their Zimbabwe dollars to the new currency. ZiG’s value will be secured by both the quantity and worth of gold and other precious metals, along with foreign currency reserves. Fielding questions during a Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) breakfast meeting held in Mutare yesterday, Dr Mushayavanhu said currently 80 percent of transactions in the country are being done in USD, but the gradual de-dollarisation process will see the margins being reduced on year-to-year basis. “The market is dollarised to the extent that 80 percent of all transactions currently happening in the country are in USD, and only 20 percent are in local currency. Government has said 50 percent of transactions should be done in local currency, so they are well ahead of us. “The Central Bank has come up with a roadmap towards de-dollarisation, and as we go towards 2030, we want to do it gradually so that maybe by the end of the year, we are at 70/30, in 2025 we are at 60/40, then in 2026 we are at 50/50 and after that we will not even care to monitor it because it will happen on its own. “You will also be seeing Government reviewing the amount you pay in ZiG for tax as we go along on that roadmap,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said the imaginary USD parallel market rates being talked about are non-existent. “As far as the parallel market is concerned, some of these rates that you are hearing are mere quotations. We have tested this system ourselves. As you know we have the Financial Intelligence Unit, and we unleashed them on the market to pose as forex buyers. For example, we tasked them to buy US$100 000 at whatever rate, and they were ready to pay. The FIU team requested to see the US$ first before transferring the funds in the individuals’ bank accounts. From 8am to 8pm they were saying we will avail the money, and at the end of the day nothing materialised. “If these transactions are happening for US$5 and US$10 for people who want to buy airtime, then it is normal in any economy. I don’t think we have a parallel market for meaningful business transactions,” he said. Asked why they have roped in the police to help curb the parallel market by arresting street money changers, Dr Mushayavanhu said the law enforcement agents are there to promote the rule of law and order. “But having said that, people are also saying why are the police being heavy handed in dealing with forex currency traders. From where we sit as a Central Bank, anyone who is trading in forex should have a licence. It is the duty of the police to intervene and arrest those committing offences. The police are there to arrest them because it is illegal for them to sell or buy forex without a licence. “You will be arrested if you do that. If you try to sell your tomatoes just outside this hotel, the municipal police will arrest you because that is not acceptable. The same is happening to illegal foreign currency dealers,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said the parallel market will eventually die a natural death during the course of the de-dollarisation roadmap. “As the Central Bank, we think that the parallel market will die a natural death,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said estimated income tax is paid on quarterly instalments – (QPDS) quarterly payment dates – March, June, September and December. Dr Mushayavanhu said ZiG is not only strengthening, but stabilising. “ZiG is a new currency fully backed by gold and other precious minerals. We are projecting that ZiG will be stable. The exchange rate will not move. In fact, if you look at what has been happening from April 5, ZiG has been strengthening. “The market has been influenced by the price of gold that has been going up which means that ZiG should naturally strengthen because its major anchor is gold. That is not because the Central Bank has been interfering with the process or has said anything,” he said. The RBZ chief said they are engaging fuel suppliers so that fuel can be purchased using ZiG, and the outcome of the engagements will soon be made public. “On the issue of ZiG buying petroleum products, we are currently seized with negotiations with players in the industry so that it becomes a possibility. We should also be aware that players in that industry are also corporate citizens, and come June they will also have to remit to Government their QPDs in ZiG,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said payments to contractors for food imports and civil servants have nothing to do with runaway parallel market rates. “Contractors are paid by Government mostly in USD. If they are paid in ZiG, it is from the stock of local currency reserves in the treasury, and not that money is being printed specifically for that. Treasury cannot borrow to pay contractors. If they are using money that is already in circulation, which is controlled, I do not see how that can cause ripples. “As regards to food imports in a semi-dollarised economy, 80 percent of transactions are in USD. What it means is that for you and me, our food requirements, even if it will be imported, it can be done by the private sector. “National Foods can use money in their FCA to import maize-meal and sell it to you in USD because we are in a multi-currency system. The vulnerable ones are covered by the treasury. Yes, the El Nino phenomenon is there, but its impact on the exchange rate and on ZiG is minimal,” he said.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/us450-000-banana-processing-plant-for-hauna/,US$450 000 banana processing plant for Hauna,"The ManicaPost   Tendai Gukutikwa
Post Reporter THE first phase of the construction of the US$450 000 banana powder/flour processing plant at Hauna Growth Point in Mutasa has commenced, and is expected to offer a lasting solution to challenges faced by horticultural producers in the province. The processing plant, the first in Manicaland, will extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by reducing spoilage and increasing the time they can be stored and consumed, making them available year-round by preserving them in different forms such as frozen, canned, or dried.   It will also reduce the risk of food-borne illness by eliminating harmful bacteria and other pathogens as well as reduce food waste by making use of fruits and vegetables that may be too ripe, damaged or unsold in their fresh state. The initiative, poised to directly benefit 600 farmers and provide sustainable support to over 2 000 others from Mutasa, Nyanga and other adjacent districts, was recently announced during a post-Cabinet briefing by Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Dr Jenfan Muswere. Dr Muswere said the project is backed by a US$450 000 grant facilitated by the African Development Bank (AfDB) via the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to the Government. It is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small to Medium Enterprises after securing the land for its construction in 2018. “The project is set to benefit 600 farmers directly and sustain more than 2 000 other farmers from Mutasa, Nyanga and many other districts in Manicaland,” said Dr Muswere. Despite facing delays since its inception in 2018, the project is now gaining momentum, offering enduring solutions to the intricate challenges encountered by horticultural producers in the province. Mutasa District stands out as a major producer of bananas and avocados, among other fruits, yet farmers grapple with numerous obstacles hindering production.
Manicaland provincial development officer in the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small to Medium Enterprises, Mr Gabriel Jaji said the business will not only serve the interests of farmers from Mutasa, but the whole nation. Mr Jaji said the establishment of the plant is expected to primarily empower women and youths in agriculture. “The processing plant was registered successfully, and now the work has started. When all phases of the project are finished, horticulture producers will be linked to lucrative local, regional and international markets,” he said. Mr Jaji said the processing plant will be used to boost economic growth and address challenges currently being faced by horticultural producers in the province. “It will also address market and transport challenges because our farmers have been paying exorbitant transport fares to get to markets in Mutare, Harare or Bulawayo. At the end of the day, their profits were being eroded through exorbitant transport and other costs incurred as they take their produce to the markets in the different cities. “We engaged farmers on the kind of plant they needed, and they suggested the setting up of a banana powder/flour plant. A farmer can sell banana flour for at least US$20 per kilogramme, which is way better than selling raw bananas for peanuts,” he said. Mr Jaji said the processed products will ensure that farmers access high value markets like supermarkets and avoid being ripped off by some unscrupulous middlemen. He also said Government took a leaf from other successful projects already running across the country like the Tasimudzirwa Women’s Gold Milling Plant in Guruve, the Madora Amacimbi Plant in Beitbridge and a tomato processing plant in Mutoko before setting up this project. As expectations mount for its operation, farmers in Mutasa and neighbouring districts have ramped up banana and avocado production. Local farmers like Ms Mazvita Murapa and Miss Chiratidzo Mawoyo eagerly anticipate the plant’s completion, foreseeing improved returns and reduced logistical costs. Ms Murapa said there is a huge difference between current market prices of raw produce and market value of processed products. Ms Murapa said bananas are selling for US$0.10 per kg at the markets in Harare and Mutare, which is a far cry from what they will get once the processing plant is in full throttle. Miss Mawoyo said the processing plant will help reduce poverty among women and youths. She decried huge losses incurred when vehicles carrying their highly perishable products to the market are involved in road accidents or have breakdowns.   "

Senior Reporter A RECORD attendance, brisk business at the host centre, properly coordinated chronology of events, exhilarating soccer matches and musical gala as well as magnificent stage works remain some of the major take-aways from this year’s national Independence Day commemorations. Business at and around Murambinda, which was last year accorded town board status, was booming courtesy of the Uhuru commemorations. Commercial activities spurred by the hosting of commemorations have never been witnessed at Murambinda. From retailing, vending to tourism, the business was oversubscribed. Not even on such revered days like Christmas, Easter and Heroes’ holidays had such lucrative sales and bookings being recorded. True to the concept of demand and supply, a product like ice cream, for example, which normally costs a dollar for two in a normal situation, was going for US$2 during the commemorations at Murambinda. A former deputy head at Murambinda A Primary School, Mr Chifuruse Mushayabasa, who ventured into agribusiness and alcohol beverage retail business was an elated lot. Mr Mushayabasa, who is also into farming and runs an up-to-the-minute Musoni Night spot at the heart of Murambinda Town Centre retired from the education sector on medical grounds after being involving in an accident. “We have benefitted in a big way by hosting this year’s Independence Day commemorations. As businesses, we never witnessed the boom in sales like we witnessed this time around. In fact, we started making super profits during the preparatory stages of the event, almost a month ago. “People who have been coming and are still coming here have been procuring commodities, products and services from different providers at the town centre. “We recorded huge sales since last Saturday when delegates began to flock to this town. As you can see, there are winding queues of people wanting to purchase goods and we are ready to serve them as quickly as we can,” he said. Mr Mushayabasa said vendors also made a lot of money during the commemorations. Some vendors were selling food, airtime and data as well as mineral water, among others. Owing to hot weather conditions prevailing on the day, it was brisk business for juice and water stalls, ice cream and fruit vendors. Heavy rush was witnessed for shops selling fruit juices, beverage drinks and alcohol. “I have been operating at this growth point (now town centre) for decades, and I can confess that I have never witnessed or recorded such brisk business. I cannot complain, we have made good money. Our busiest days are usually during the Christmas holiday, but this was unprecedented. It has been something else,” he said. Small eateries and vendors selling fruit juices and water did brisk business, especially near the venue. Mr Joe Simboti was one of them. Mr Simboti, a vendor at Murambinda for years sells airtime, ice cream, edibles such as fresh chips and chicken, among others. “I wish if we could permanently host this national calendar event. Whoever came up with this idea that Independence Day commemorations should be decentralised must have had my business in mind. “I have made profits that I never made since I started vending in this area, some six years ago. We are thankful to President Mnangagwa and the organisers of this event for bringing big business to us here at Murambinda,” he said. Hotels, lodges and other informal traders at Murambinda also recorded huge sales as delegates attending the commemorations thronged these areas for accommodation and to purchase different wares. There was heightened activity for almost a fortnight prior to big day as delegates thronged different hotels and lodges to have a feel of the services. A chef who works at a local hotel, who spoke to this publication on condition of anonymity, said all hotel rooms were fully booked before the commemorations, resulting in some clients being turned away due to the overwhelming demand. At the end of it all, it was the province of Manicaland that was left with its tail wagging and walking with a spring in its step after hosting such a hugely successful national event. No wonder, the Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs, Advocate Misheck Mugadza, in a post event analysis interview, thanked all stakeholders who worked tirelessly for the successful hosting of the country’s 44th Independence Day commemorations. “We are very happy that our Independence Day celebrations went on very well. People came out in their numbers. The President gave us a very, very special message that will go a long way in guiding us as a province and as a nation. “The whole event from the start went on well without any disturbances. I am grateful to the local organising team, they worked very hard. “We thank Vice President Kembo Mohadi who chairs the Cabinet Committee for State Occasions and National Monuments. We are really thankful to his guidance and all relevant Government departments. Everyone participated whole heartedly,” he said.   "

The financial fitness academy will be an annual event that will equip entrepreneurs with the relevant skills that will see them grow their business while compliant to the financial inclusion requirements in line with the National Financial Inclusion Strategy II, 2022- 2026 (NFIS II). Stanbic Bank’s Head of Enterprise Banking, Ms Auxilia Kambasha said the financial fitness academy will be in the form of training workshops countrywide through which customers will be equipped with financial modelling to assist them to draw up financial statements and tax compliance requirements, among other administrative and governance procedures. “The overarching goal of the bank is to partner our clients for growth. We are offering the training so that our clients develop and grow their business as they would have been equipped with financial basics that will assist them to make right decisions. The financial fitness academy will equip entrepreneurs with relevant skills that are critical and sustainable in achieving growth of their business while being compliant,” said Ms Kambasha. She said the first series of the training workshops recently kicked off in Gweru, Kwekwe and Chegutu. Ms Kambasha said investing in critical skills in the promotion of the SMEs will result in ripple effects in the growth of the economy which is the thrust of NFIS II. Financial inclusion is on the rise globally and continues to be a key enabler in wealth creation, poverty reduction, and improving the livelihoods of people in low-income groups. Ms Kambasha said Stanbic Bank is inspired by the quest to bring people and institutions together and maximise on their interconnectedness for mutual benefit. Stanbic Bank is aware that SMEs play a pivotal role in driving both developing and developed economies, contributing significantly to poverty reduction, employment creation, value addition, and economic resilience. “As Stanbic Bank, we believe that developing economies must prioritise financial literacy, access to financial products and supporting frameworks that ensure holistic growth and development,” said Ms Kambasha. To that end, the Standard Bank Group subsidiary is committed to equip SMEs with the key growth drivers on the back of the knowledge. Key factors that promote inclusion for SMEs include the cost of products and services; the complexity of financial products and services and the treatment received from service providers during the attempted access. “As Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe Enterprise Banking, we are eager to train our customers in financial modelling to assist them to draw up financial statements and tax compliance requirements, so that every business small or big moves together ushering in an era of development, poverty alleviation and resilience. “Our vision is “to achieve universal access and usage of a broad range of quality and affordable financial services that meet the needs of both individuals and enterprises.”,” she said. Ms Kambasha said Stanbic Bank wants to ensure that every segment of Zimbabwean society has access to basic financial services irrespective of social or economic status, gender, or level of education. She said access to, and usage of a broad range of quality and affordable financial products and services would open up opportunities for better livelihoods.   It provides a platform for low-income populations with the mechanisms to borrow, save and invest, and make payments.   Further, it enables them to plan ahead and better manage their finances. “Our financial fitness model provides a framework that will lead to the development of a stable, resilient, competitive, and inclusive financial sector that contributes to economic growth and broad-based wealth creation,” said Ms Kambasha, adding that Stanbic Bank understand that it has a role to play and is committed to actively work toward the attainment of enabling growth of SMEs.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/manicaland-exports-rake-in-us53-2m/,Manicaland exports rake in US$53.2m,"The ManicaPost   Lovemore Kadzura
Post Correspondent MANICALAND’S ideal climatic conditions have spurred the production of organic horticultural produce which has enabled the province to increase its exports and rake in about US$53.2 million into the country. Manicaland — a gateway to Mozambique — has good climatic conditions that make it ideal to produce diversified crops like macadamia nuts, tea, avocados, coffee, herbal tea, pineapples, cut flowers, bananas peas, carrots, cauliflower, sweet potatoes and stone fruits, organic ginger, turmeric and garlic, among others, with the ability to thrive in the export markets. Horticulture is one of the export low-hanging fruits for businesses and communities in Manicaland, and the sector has immense potential to gain a strong global competitive position, thereby providing substantial social and economic benefits to the province and the country at large. Further to this, the global markets for organic horticultural products remain attractive, and Manicaland has the potential to take over supply of the global horticulture market as production of fruits and vegetables drifts away from industrialised nations. The current boon in avocado exports comes at a time Manicaland has been steadily increasing its avocado exports from 2 746 tonnes in 2017 to 5 806 tonnes in 2021. The increase is due to improved production and new smallholder farmers planting more trees, making Zimbabwe the fifth largest exporter of avocados in Africa. Of late, there has been massive investments in the horticulture sector, which has resulted in improved productivity on the farms and estates, particularly through joint ventures. Buoyed by the new investments in the horticultural sector, the country is expected to lead the pack in the near future. Zimbabwe’s horticultural produce is on high demand in countries like the Netherlands, South Africa, China, United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates. Among the latest investments in the sector is a joint venture between Agriculture and Rural Development Authority (ARDA) and a private firm, Cicada, to grow avocados and macadamia nuts at its Katiyo Estate in Honde Valley. The partnership will result in increased horticultural exports from the province. ARDA board chairman, Mr Irvin Craig confirmed the development and said the joint venture, sitting on 505 hectares, has so far created employment for 325 people, tendering avocado plantations with about 300 tonnes of avocado produce already harvested and destined for the European market. “We have a contract farming agreement under the Public-Private Partnership Framework to establish at least a combined 500 hectares of avocado and macadamia nuts plantations with the produce targeted for export. “Under this agreement, we have planted Hass Avocados on 312 hectares and macadamia nuts on 193 hectares to have a total planted area of 505 hectares. Harvesting is still in progress, and to date 300 tonnes of avocados have been harvested. Our main market is mainly European countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Harvesting of commercial crop for macadamia is expected from the 2024/25 season. The current establishment has 325 employees,” he said. ZimTrade Manicaland Region manager, Mr Admire Jongwe said the province has vast opportunities to expand the horticultural sector and grow the country’s export revenue. Mr Jongwe also called upon established firms to incorporate smallholder farmers as out-growers. “Produce from the province, which have been driving national horticultural exports, include macadamia nuts, tea, avocados, coffee, herbal tea, pineapples, cut flowers, bananas and stone fruits. There is scope to grow the export of horticulture produce in Manicaland, leveraging on crops that can perform well in the province such as peas, carrots, cauliflower and sweet potatoes. “Sweet potatoes are mainly grown in Chipinge and Makoni districts where we are encouraging farmers to concentrate on viable varieties such as the yellow-fleshed ones. Further to this, there is scope to grow exports of sesame seed, widely grown in Chipinge, Nyanga, Makoni and Buhera districts. This crop has great potential for the province, considering its huge demand in the Mozambique market whose proximity to the province offers additional logistical and competitive advantages. “Flowers, which already have a lucrative market in countries such as the Netherlands offer export opportunities for growers in Nyanga, Vumba and Mutare. To grow the flowers output, there is need for established players in the sector to bring on board smaller players which will guarantee them access to markets,” he said. Mr Jongwe said Manicaland is also emerging as a key producer of chillies, peppers, wild fruits, essential oils and processed foods and heritage-based products. According to the Horticultural Development Council, the country is likely to export around 6 000 tonnes of avocados this year, and there is need to penetrate new markets such as China and India. “The 2024 season looks promising for Zimbabwean avocados. We are trying to export 6 000 tonnes, which will be the country’s biggest crop yet. Credit should be given to increased production from new producers from an estimated 1 500 hectares planted to date. “More investment is needed in infrastructure such as pack houses. We are working with stakeholders to push for new markets such as China, India and other South East Asian (countries) so that Zimbabwe remains competitive,” said the council in a statement on its X handle.   "

Post Reporter BUHERA has received a major shot in the arm following the implementation of key economic drivers that form the basis of its transformative development trajectory ahead of the 2024 national Independence Day Celebrations at Murambinda B High School grounds.   From rehabilitation of the road network to the construction of a modern standard pitch, new classroom blocks have been built, while others have received a facelift. Owing to the district’s severe aridity, boreholes have been sunk to augment the provision of water for domestic consumption and productive uses.   Significant strides have been made in equipping the water sources with the requisite solar powered accessories to make them fully functional. These are the long-term benefits the people of Buhera will continue enjoying after successfully hosting the independence commemorations. These projects are a vehicle for high impact and life-changing fruitful outcomes, fuelling the country’s drive towards Vision 2030 to attain an empowered and prosperous upper-middle income society. The end game of these initiatives and programmes being rolled out by the Second Republic is inclusive development — a state of progression and transformation that leaves no one and no place behind. Firm foundation Under the ongoing Presidential Rural Development Programme, previously marginalised areas are also prominently featuring in the national transformational growth matrix. Government’s Rural Development 8.0 initiative — whose other components include the Vision 2030 Accelerator Model, Pfumvudza/Intwasa, Presidential Poultry Scheme, the Presidential Goat Scheme, Presidential Fisheries Scheme, Presidential Blitz Tick Grease Scheme and the Presidential Cotton Inputs Scheme — is igniting unprecedented expansion in the countryside. Under this programme, Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) is set to drill 35 000 boreholes in the country’s eight rural provinces, translating to a borehole each for every village among the 35 000 by 2025. Cue the village business units (VBUs) In line with the Second Republic’s rural industrialisation agenda, the roll out of VBUs is already underway and already 50 VBUs have been established in Buhera alone, while another 50 are expected to be up and running ahead of the Uhuru celebrations. VBUs are broad-based viable enterprises envisaged to have multiple benefits to rural communities. They comprise of one-hectare drip irrigated nutrition and horticulture garden, water storage reservoirs, fish ponds, orchards and poultry projects. The areas largely targeted are in regions four and five — which are ordinarily dry areas. In Manicaland, VBUs have also been established in Chisuma, Temaruru, Tamburikayi, Hakwata, Chichesa, Mutema Secondary and at Chief Mutema’s homestead. A visit to Buhera last week revealed that work is already at advanced stages to operationalise the VBUs into vibrant enterprises. Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister, Dr Anxious Masuka last week toured some of the completed VBUs, including one at Dzenga in Village 14, Buhera West Constituency. Acting Chief Director for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Advisory Services, Mr Leonard Munamati said VBUs will be established alongside youth business units and school business units. He said these are robust measures being put in place to mitigate the adverse impact of the El Nino-induced drought that ravaged the 2023/24 summer cropping season and threatened food security in the province. Beyond that, the VBUs will ensure the provision of clean and safe water sources as well as food and nutrition and financial security to the rural population. The beneficiaries receive seed from Government to kick-start their agricultural ventures.
“The Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries and Rural Development is currently involved in the drilling of boreholes and establishing VBUs, youth business units and school business units. The target is to establish at least 10 000 VBUs by the end of this year and to achieve that, we are targeting to establish at least 1 000 VBUs, YBUs and SBUs every month,” said Mr Munamati. He said each VBU occupies one hectare and has a solar-powered borehole which will be fitted with tanks to facilitate drip irrigation. “These VBUs are normally about one hectare each and have a borehole that is drilled on site and that borehole will have solar-powered tanks installed so that there is drip irrigation. These are very important components because if we managed 10 000 of these it will mean 10 000 hectares of irrigated land,” he explained.    Work is already at advanced stages to operationalise the VBUs in Buhera into vibrant enterprises, with 50 already established while another 50 are expected to be up and running soon The VBUs will also carry out aquaculture and horticulture, he added. “The boreholes will, among other functions, provide drinking water for the communities, provide water for the establishment of nutritional gardens, orchards, fishery projects and water for dip-tanks,” he said. Mechanisation and optimisation The VBUs are receiving technical, extension and advisory support from Government through the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development to mechanise and optimise their operations to ensure sustainability. To maximise viability, collaborative and synchronised efforts between Government departments and agencies like Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA), Agriculture and Rural Development Authority (ARDA), Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), Agriculture and Rural Development Advisory Service (ARDAS — formerly Agritex) and Agriculture Marketing Authority (AMA), among others, will steer the VBUs. ARDA develops the business model for the VBUs and assists in their registration as formal entities run on sound commercial lines by locals. AMA contributes in the identification and linkages to markets for the VBUs’ products, which also determines the various crops they can viably grow. AFC provides the funding while ARDAS is responsible for extension and advisory services.
Previously marginalised rural communities are set to reap the fruits of the programme, with women and young people being the main targeted beneficiaries. Villagers in Buhera hailed the VBUs project, commending Government for initiating and implementing programmes that benefit rural communities. The villagers said farming can be a very lucrative venture when run as a business. “As villagers we are excited that we can now run a business of our own through farming. We are now utilising the land which had been lying idle, thanks to the availability of water sources that can facilitate drip irrigation. We will work hard to produce food for ourselves and also sell the produce to earn an income. By next month, we should be able to market some of our produce,” said Mrs Gracious Magumbo. A youth in the area, Mr Aleck Mabwe said with this latest development their lives will never be the same again. “Given that we live in a dryland water is an essential resource. These solar-powered boreholes are a real game-changer that will go a long way to transform our lives. With drip irrigation, we are geared for increased production and productivity,” he said. Water is one of the most important resources required in enhancing people’s livelihoods and is just what the doctor ordered for the nutrition gardens to grow a wide range of fruit trees in the villages. NDS 1-driven Vision 2030 Crucially, the projects being implemented by the Second Republic speak to the 14 key pillars of National Development Strategy (NDS1) — the country’s development blueprint to achieve the national aspiration of Vision 2030. Director for Agricultural Advisory and Rural Development Services (Manicaland), Mrs Phillipa Rwambiwa said VBUs are a game changer to transform rural communities. “The VBUs operated using solar-powered boreholes will open up avenues for the local communities to establish horticulture gardens, drip irrigation for high-value horticultural crops and nutrition gardens as well as fisheries, and piped water schemes. “This is one way of empowering rural women and young people to cater for their needs without depending on others. When run sustainably, the VBUs become commercially viable, which will enable the local communities to make profits and savings. Overall, this promotes new enterprise development, job creation and employment,” said Mrs Rwambiwa. She said poverty reduction is also hinged on the operations of VBUs, thereby increasing the quality of life for rural people through improved livelihoods and multiple streams of incomes. This, she added, should accelerate the attainment of Vision 2030 by ensuring food security, import substitution, poverty alleviation, access to safe and clean water and creating employment opportunities. Food and nutrition security President Mnangagwa’s administration is moving to promote resilience and sustainable farming through agriculture infrastructure development.   This is evidenced by the ongoing and continuous investment in agriculture research and technology development to enhance farming output. Accelerated agricultural production and productivity is a critical factor leading to the escalation of food self-sufficiency, which the Second Republic is working to increase from the current level to 100 percent. “Food and nutrition security is one of the 14 national priority areas in NDS1. ‘‘With these VBUs we can achieve that end while communal livelihoods also get greatly improved. They ameliorate hunger, starvation and poverty. This also accelerates value addition and beneficiation of agriculture production while also increasing productivity,” she said.   "

Senior Reporter OLD age think-tanks once wrote that looters don’t read, and readers don’t loot, but the unabated and alarming rate of mineral leakages, especially diamonds, lithium and gold, across the country and Manicaland in particular, is just too difficult to ignore. Ideally, mineral leakages are predominantly in the gold sub-sector and other precious and semi-precious stones like diamonds through smuggling and diversion to the informal market.   Experts estimate that the country could be losing billions of United States of America dollars annually through leakages. In the gold and lithium sub-sectors, of late, there have been reports of smuggling of minerals to countries such as South Africa, Dubai and China. Diamonds, for example, after being stolen from companies operating in the nearby Marange area, find a ready market in several buyers of foreign origin resident in some of Mutare’s leafy suburbs. A check by The Manica Post revealed that several foreign nationals, some with tertiary student status permits to justify their presence in the country, have set base in suburbs like Murambi, Morningside, Greenside and Fairbridge Park.   Gold buyers have also thronged Penhalonga area near Mutare where the mineral is sold in piecemeal to Fidelity Printers — the formal trend — but a considerable amount is reportedly being smuggled out of the country. In addition, it has also been reported that semi-precious stones discovered in some parts of the country like Hurungwe and Karoi in Mashonaland West Province where villagers extracted the stones without going through the normal processes that ensure Zimbabwe benefits as a nation, are allegedly smuggling the minerals. In an interview on the sidelines of the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development two-day workshop in Vumba last week, chairman of the Portfolio Committee, Honourable Joseph Msipa said they are seized with the matter of minerals leakage. “We are indeed concerned about the leakage of minerals as a committee. This is the reason why we will soon be calling for an indaba where we will bring together relevant stakeholders so that we map the way forward as a team. We are putting forward our suggestion as a committee to see the improvement of security on minerals in the country, and we hope we will achieve what we aspire to,” said the Shurugwi North parliamentarian. In a separate interview, speaking from a mining employees representative view, tough talking Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Union (ZFTU) secretary general, Cde Kennias Shamuyarira, said: “We have a well-orchestrated mafia extractive syndicate, right from some unscrupulous Government officials, colluding with the so-called investors at the expense of the working class and the majority citizenry. “Real economic development in a country can only be realised when we have radical policies on beneficiation and value addition to all our minerals and other natural resources.”   After extraction, gemstones such as amethyst, aquamarine, and garnet are illegally sold to unscrupulous dealers who smuggle and export the semi-precious and coloured stones in their raw form.   Cde Shamuyarira added: “I think we need to be very frank and candid to each other as a country and as a people. The whole issue starts from the investor, who comes into our space here in Zimbabwe, coming to invest in diamond, platinum or gold mining. “All the other countries that developed or are on the development path, they (investors) go there fully aware that they will put something and get something out of their initiative, and the people in the country they will be investing in, will also get something. “But our situation is so absurd. It is very skewed in the sense that you take a company like the now defunct Mbada Diamonds, they came with their machinery and expertise and all that we benefitted was employment of general hand workers. “Over and above that, there was no beneficiation. You cannot talk of beneficiation by a company of that magnitude when they built houses for displaced villagers. That was a prerequisite just like protective clothing for employees.”   Cde Shamuyarira said beneficiation should be noticed from the production of the end products, and not export of raw minerals as a way of also addressing rampant leakages of mineral. “The diamond was mined and is being mined, but there is no beneficiation. We should be having a polishing site where we employ people. After polishing diamonds, we must have the end product of rings, bracelets and so on. “That is what we call beneficiation, and once we have that we can curb leakages. “These diamonds are taken raw as they are to other people who know how to beneficiate our resources. This is why our theme for Workers Day this year touches on confronting extractive and parasitic investment. “These are the kinds of investments we are talking about whereby the country itself does not benefit and the employees do not benefit at all. You look at the salaries that people are being paid in these mines, it’s a pittance, save for the few middle management that serve the interest of the shareholders. “The rest are being paid amounts under the Poverty Datum Line and are wallowing in abject poverty, without any healthcare and education benefits. Overal, we do not see us as a country benefiting anything from these investments, simply because we do not have the end product being produced here,” he said. The gathering in Vumba was meant to establish a strong foundation for collaboration between MMCZ and the Parliamentary Committee, while equipping participants with a comprehensive understanding of the MMCZ’s mandate, strategic direction, and current operations. MMCZ was established to monitor and promote the export of all minerals produced in Zimbabwe with the exception of gold and silver which are dealt with by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.   Zimbabwe has 60 different mineral products, half of them currently being exported, but the country has been losing revenue from these minerals export owing to leakages at porous ports of exit such as Forbes Border Post in Mutare. While MMCZ has been monitoring movement of minerals from production site, with their inspectors operating within mineral producing sites, and partially through the export process, they have not been allowed to be stationed at the country’s ports of exit under the excuse that their presence would militate against ease of doing business. In their contribution during the MMCZ Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development workshop, a number of Members of Parliament emphasized the need to have MMCZ presence felt. Mutare North Member of the House of Assembly Cde Admire Mahachi said. “There is need to have MMCZ present at the place where minerals are getting outside the country. This is their actual job. Their job is not primarily in the offices, but in the field and the border is one place where they have to ensure that the country is not losing anything though their presence,” he said. Headlands Member of House of Assembly, Cde Farai Mapfumo said the country must not sacrifice the God-given minerals on the altar of ease of doing business. “Yes, we need to be seen to be facilitating the ease of doing business. No one denies that. However, we should not be seen to be sacrificing the God-given minerals on the altar of ease of doing business. “There are ways that can certainly be worked out to ensure that we secure our minerals, while at the same time provide ease of doing business for our visitors or investors.
“MMCZ should be right at the border and given space to operate without necessarily hindering the smooth flow of business at a given border post,” he said. Ideally, minerals are a finite resource that needs to be utilised for the benefit of the nation when extracted. Apart from being finite, the international prices of minerals fluctuate, further buttressing the need to utilise extracted minerals when they still have value. For example, the acute down spiraling of tantalite prices on the international market has resulted in the sudden disappearance of both local and foreign mining investors who had invaded Buhera District. Fielding questions from Members of the House of Assembly during the Vumba workshop, MMCZ’s corporate’s marketing manager, Mr Gumisai Nenzou said: “There is a fluctuation of the prices of minerals that we actively market as MMCZ. For example, there was once a hype around tantalite mining in Buhera District here in Manicaland. The demand was spurred by cellphone manufacturing clients who needed the product. “We saw numerous tantalite mining bases being set up in Buhera, and at the time tantalite was going for US$1 200 per kilogramme. Today, the same product has drastically gone down to US$100 for the same weight. “Given the production costs and other mining related expenses, it might no longer make any business sense, hence the disappearance of those who were mining it in Buhera,” said Mr Nenzou.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/manicaland-embraces-new-zig-currency/,Manicaland embraces new ZiG currency,"The ManicaPost   Liberty Dube
Post Correspondent FOLLOWING the introduction of the gold-backed currency —Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) last Friday — businesses and members of the public in Manicaland have expressed confidence that it will hold fort against other currencies that will circulate alongside it. Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) last week unveiled ZiG as part of several policy measures to address exchange rate volatility, curtail inflation and restore macro-economic stability in the country. RBZ Governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu said ZiG will circulate alongside a basket of other currencies, and Zimbabweans have 21 days to convert their old cash into new money. He announced that the Zimbabwe dollar remains legal tender for all domestic transactions until April 30, when ZiG notes and coins will come into circulation. The 21-day transitional period will see the Central Bank conducting an extensive educational and awareness campaign on the new currency’s structure and security features before the notes and coins are released at the end of this. The Central Bank also asserted that ZiG’s value will be secured by both the quantity and worth of precious metals, along with the foreign currency reserves it maintains. Those interviewed by The Manica Post yesterday expressed optimism that the new currency will hold its own against other currencies circulating on the market. The new currency has kicked illegal money changers in Mutare, Rusape and Chipinge below the belt as most of them have vanished from their customary trading locations in the Central Business District (CBD).   Only small groups of money changers lingered near their customary spots that were bustling hubs before ZiG’s debut. Mr Lovejoy Saunyama, a kombi operator who plies the City — Dangamvura route in Mutare could not wait for the circulation of the new money. He said he is having a torrid time with passengers over the issue of change. “We are still accepting the RTGs until April 30 because we realised that the commuters should be allowed to use the currency they have in their wallets or pockets, be it RTGS or US$. “To us the introduction of ZiG is welcome and was long overdue. “We cannot wait for its circulation, come April 30. We are eager to see its real impact when it eventually hits the streets. Most kombi routes are US$0.50 cents, and it is imperative for Government to quickly address this issue,” he said. Mr Tendai Marange, who sells construction material like burglar bars, door and window frames at Murahwa People’s Green Market, said ZiG is welcome, considering that most bond notes, especially of smaller denominations were no longer useful as traders were rejecting them due to their eroded value. “It had become a nightmare to transact in RTGS cash, especially when you need to buy foreign currency. “For now, we are trusting the process, although we are yet to get hold of ZiG. We believe it will serve its intended purpose. “My bank is yet to allow us to transact in the new currency, but I am sure that the development will provide a win-win situation between clients and businesses,” he said. A money changer who requested anonymity said: “I can’t lie; business has been low my brother. We are all in a state of confusion, and do not know what to do. “We are yet to figure out how we will be operating when ZiG notes hit the streets. Our clients are equally confused, especially concerning the issue of conversion rates. For now, we are currently dealing with United States dollars and South African rands.” Mr Munyaradzi Zinomwe, a social commentator and businessman, said he is excited about the development. “It is a very positive move to the transacting industry. “With the spiralling black market rate on ZWL, a bold move was urgently needed. We wait for April 30 when ZiG notes will be hitting the market. We are confident and hopeful that this move will be beneficial to all of us,” he said. A bar operator from Chikanga said Government, through the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has a critical task to educate people on how ZiG will operate. “It is very important for them to let us understand more about the new currency so as to build confidence. They should launch a media blitz like roadshows, newspapers, radio and TV adverts and reach out to everyone educating them about the new currency,” he said.   "

Post Correspondent OVER 50 million kilogrammes of tobacco have gone under the hammer since the opening of the marketing season last month, with growers pocketing over US$176m, a 12 percent increase in earnings compared to the same period last season. Statistics released by the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) on Day 20 shows that the average price for contracted tobacco was US$3.52, while at the traditional auction floor the price was US$3.65. Contracted tobacco has contributed 47 094 959 million kilogrammes, while self-financed was at a distant 3 084 398m kgs. About 94 percent of tobacco is grown under contract farming, and farmers are paid 75 percent in foreign currency and 25 percent in local currency. Tobacco unions have been rooting for 100 percent retention, arguing that their foreign currency earnings were being drained while paying production costs charged in USD. Due to the skewed arrangement, tobacco farmers are largely victims rather than beneficiaries of the contract system as contractors inflate USD prices of inputs, under-supply them with inputs required per hectare and make unilateral deductions on earnings of farmers, thereby leaving many in debt. A total of 689 809 bales have been delivered to the floors, with contract bales amounting to 638 720 and those at auction floors amounting to 51 089. A combined 20 088 bales were rejected. The highest price for auction floors tobacco stood at US$5.05, while the contract auction has hit a ceiling of US$6.99, up from last season’s high of US$5.60. The lowest quality leaf attracted US$0.10 per kg, which remains the same from last season. The firming of the prices during this marketing season has been attributed to high quality and depressed volumes of the leaf due to the El Nino-induced dry spell. Tobacco Farmers Union Trust president, Mr Victor Mariranyika said the auctioning is progressing on well without major hindrance. He said this year’s prices were fairly higher than those of last season, which will allow growers to break-even. “So far the auctioning is going on very well at all floors, save for one company that is struggling to pay growers on time. Cash is readily available at the banks and farmers are accessing their money without hassles. Unlike last season where the prices were low, this season’s prices have improved, and we hope this will continue until the end of the season. “Last season most auction floors had US$4 as their ceiling price, but this season the prices have shot above US$5.99 depending on the quality. The average price this year is US$3.50 compared to US$2.50 that obtained last season,” said Mr Mariranyika. He also implored TIMB to strictly implement stringent statutory measures introduced by Government for both growers and merchants to safeguard the integrity of the contract system so that farmers are not short-changed while guaranteeing contractors’ returns on their investment. He said tobacco merchants failing to pay farmers on time as per requirements must be blacklisted, deregistered and barred from contract farmers without first paying them, lest it becomes a free-for-all situation. “However we call upon TIMB to investigate some deductions being effected on the growers’ earnings. Some of the deductions are not part of the contract between growers and the merchants. TIMB must not abandon growers at the critical juncture, but take these concern serious and make sure they do not persist. “Tobacco growers are bitter that instead of protecting them, TIMB is sitting on the fence leaving them at the mercy of greedy merchants. “Growers need every cent they are entitled to earn a return on their investments, and it is a cumulative of these dubious deductions that pushes them out of business. Farming is a business, and it is the profit that keeps tobacco growers going,” said Mr Mariranyika.   "

Senior Reporter WHILE the El Nino phenomenon inflicted a prolonged dry spell that adversely affected the production of food, leading to the declaration of a state of disaster in the country, the same weather condition has seen a boon in the timber industry which is reportedly accruing profits. Zimbabwe’s commercial timber industries are largely concentrated in the Eastern Highlands of Manicaland, given its favourable climatic and environmental conditions for the fast growing exotic species. In an interview on the performance of the sector against a background of the El Nino-induced drought, Timber Producers Federation of Zimbabwe (TPFZ) chief executive officer, Mr Darlington Duwa said normal seasons are usually problematic by making timber harvesting operations deleterious as the roads will be slippery, while plantations will be inaccessible. “The effects of the dry spell had mixed effects on the timber industry. In a normal season (with abundant rains), timber harvesting operations are deleteriously affected as roads will be slippery and timber compartments become inaccessible, particularly those on steep slopes and heavy soils. “This necessitates expensive road rehabilitation as well as increase in the cost of production. In this context, the El Nino phenomenon has helped timber producers,” he said. Mr Duwa said timber drying has also been made easier with the dry spell. “Air drying of produced timber is quicker in dry weather. The industry does not have adequate artificial (kiln-drying) capacity, hence their reliance on natural (air drying). As a result, the El Nino phenomenon has assisted in timber drying,” he said. However, the dry spell also had its fair share of negative impact to the industry. “Despite the positive impacts outlined above, there are negative impacts, chief among them being the negative effect on the growth of trees — this has slowed the growth rates, with tree mortality in the most extreme of cases. “Tree planting is also affected as this has led to reduced tree planting. Already our planting targets for 2023/2024 have been negatively affected. There is also the aspect of increased production costs as employees need to be nutritionally assisted,” he said. “Overly, the association is happy with the rate at which members are planting. Members of the public, perhaps would like to see higher rates of planting. However, it is not planting alone which is important. The maintenance of the plantations (silviculture) is important if one is to realise quality products at the end of the rotation. “The current and projected short term economic situation may not allow timber companies to plant and maintain large areas of plantations. “However, it would be good if the rate of planting could be maintained at current rates without negative fluctuations,” he added. Mr Duwa outlined some factors that hinder large-scale plantations. “Several factors hinder large-scale planting. The most important are the financial resources for land preparation, planting, weeding, pruning and thinning. They work against large-scale planting. “Financial resources to maintain the trees — weeding, pruning and thinning, labour to carry out the operations and equipment for operations, are some of the factors that have a bearing on the size of a plantation,” he said. Mr Duwa said weather conditions also have an effect on planting patterns. “Weather conditions — planting is done when adequate rains have been received, to achieve acceptable seedling survival rates and tree growth. Sound forest management requires that forests are planted in such a way that one has evenly distributed age classes not just one huge age class. “One can use an analogy of tomatoes. If you plant a large area of tomatoes, they usually ripe at once and you have to harvest them. If one is to lose the planted area due to say fire or pests, this will be terrible loss,” he said. Mr Duwa said the prices of timber products are fair, but bemoaned ‘dumping of products to third parties’. “We are happy as an industry with the prices obtaining on the market, but there seems to be dumping of products mainly by third parties who sell wet timber. Customers are advised to use dry timber for structural works,” he said.   "

Entertainment Correspondent FOR someone who started off as a young preacher, ministering to youths during Scripture Union – releasing a soulful seven-track gospel album after becoming a professional musician is quite a feat for Reverend Mathias Ngove. Reverend Ngove, a clergy with Divine Tribe International Ministries, has taken his dream of transforming lives through the gospel by releasing a seven-track album titled, Jesus My Everything. The project features tracks like Mhere-mhere, which is an advice to youths to shun drugs and substance abuse, given its detrimental impact on their health and future. The title track, Jesus My Everything is a call for people to seek the Lord, lean on Him in season and out of season. Another track, Makatipa Zvipo is an appreciation to Christ for blessing mankind with children and various gifts upon birth. The other track, My Bible and I, encourages young people to read the Word of God so that they live for Christ, while Torai Moyo Wangu is a hymnal song that encourages people to trust God for a bright future. Reverend Ngove will tomorrow launch the album at Courtauld Theatre, where Mutare’s top gospel artistes like Dorcas Moyo, Blessing Shumba, Carol Chidzikwe, Vimbai Dimba, Petty Mukanganwa, Cloris Muchuwaire, Billy Ngoreta, Ellen Anderson, Nyasha Chiripashi and Blessed Musendo are billed to perform. Born in Chivhu, Reverend Ngove went to St Paul’s Kuimba Primary School before proceeding to Norton where he did his secondary education at Vimbai High School. He discovered his artistic gift when he became part of playwrights at school. “The issue of drug and substance abuse is worrisome. Our youths’ future has been destroyed. I wrote the song with deep concern, and believe it will play a critical role in the fight against the scourge,” he said, before adding: “I grew well spiritually and discovered that I had a gift of ministering to young people. I joined Scripture Union as a volunteer and was able to reach out to young people. My music career developed as I realised ministering to young people involved singing. By the grace of God, a door was opened for me to go to Northern Ireland where I was involved in ministering to students. “My musical career shot when I met an Irish lady called Gillian who introduced me to a guitar and taught me how to play. And by the same grace, someone bought me a guitar right there and I carried it back to my country. “I am glad that I still have it. Having trained as a pastor, music was part of my ministering for many years before I thought of going into the studio. “I thank God that in 2023, I was able to produce an album, Mwari Haashanduke, which was well received,” he said. Reverend Ngove is backed by the Generations in Worship (GIWO).   "

Entertainment Correspondent NATIONAL Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) will launch the 2024 edition of the National Culture Month commemorations at Chisumbanje in Chipinge District at the end of this month. The event which is meant to preserve and celebrate the country’s diverse cultural identity will be held in Chief Garahwa’s area under the theme: “Our Culture, Building Zimbabwe Brick by Brick”. Vice President Kembo Mohadi will be the guest of honour at the event expected to draw hundreds of people, among them arts and cultural groups from Manicaland and beyond.
It is also expected to attract several traditional leaders as well as dignitaries from across the country. NAC Manicaland provincial manager, Carol Makoni said preparations for the national event are progressing well. She said the province is excited to host the prestigious cultural event. “Preparations are underway and we are happy with the progress so far. It will be a huge and potentially-intriguing event which will attract a lot of stakeholders as well as visual and performing artistes. Manicaland will take the opportunity to showcase local traditional dances, crafts and traditional foods, among other cultural artefacts. The itinerary will be packed and we are expecting thousands of people to grace the event,” she said. Culture Month commemorations are an extension of World Day of Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, which is celebrated on May 21 – which was set aside by UNESCO in the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity in 2001. This is a huge boost for art and cultural groups in Manicaland as they are set to showcase the province’s rich cultural brand. One of the most successful arts groups in Manicaland – Manicaland Attached Instruments and Dance Exploration (M.A.I.D.E) is excited to have the national event on their home turf. The group was recently awarded a US$33 000 grant for an arts research project. The project — CreativeACTIONs 2 (2023-25) — is the brainchild of Culture Fund of Zimbabwe Trust, in collaboration with European Union. M.A.I.D.E comprises Charlton Torindo, Joseph Sithole and Kudzai Gwaze. More than 100 arts and cultural groups from across Manicaland Province as well as across the country are set to fully explore traditional dances and instruments that originated in Manicaland. Every district in Manicaland has its own eccentric dances such as Zhana (Makoni), Jaka (Buhera), Muchongoyo, Mhongo, Chokoto (Chipinge), Mangoni (Mutasa), Njekunje (Nyanga) and Chidzimba/Chimaisiri (Mutare) and these are expected to be showcased at the launch. “We are excited that the national launch will take place in Manicaland Province. This is a milestone and we are working hard to ensure that we fully utilise the historic opportunity. We are a province which is culturally rich with a lot of supremely talented visual and performing artistes. We are looking forward to dishing what Manicaland has to offer as well as to learn from other cultures from various provinces from across the country,” said a member of the group, Joseph Sithole. Last year’s launch was held in Binga, in Matebeleland North Province. President Mnangagwa officiated at the event which was held under the theme: “Promoting Cultural Diversity, Unity and Peace”.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/blabbermouth-all-that-glitters-isnt-gold/,BLABBERMOUTH: All that glitters isn’t gold,"The ManicaPost   THE greatest tragedy of our generation is that we have people who spend a lot, but have never worked anywhere. One wonders where they would have amassed so much wealth.   Even their age does not correspond with the amount of wealth in their possession. Blabber is not jealous of those who are blessed to the extent of making so much money in a short space of time, but Yours Truly is only worried about our dear young ones, who then try to imitate those big spenders and end up dipping their fingers in cash boxes that do not belong to them. This is the story of a young girl who used to live a lavish lifestyle.   Many are familiar with her in our beautiful city because of her spending spree. Her name is reminiscent of that other deceased princess from the Queen’s land. Yes, I mean the globally acclaimed princess who died some decades ago in that horrific car crash. While the deceased princess was known more because of her philanthropic work, our wayward princess was known for patronising different up-market watering holes where she purchased expensive bottles. She was known for having fun throughout the week, and would create a carnival atmosphere wherever she was — whatever time — all because of her perceived fat wallet. Gentle reader, she was a party animal! What we did not know all along was that she was busy stealing from her employer to fund her insatiable appetite for expensive items. This only came to light recently when she fled the country after her employer audited the cash flows in the company. It emerged that the fuel retail company was fleeced of a substantial amount of money that was diverted to her personal use over a period of time. As Yours Truly pens this piece, our uncultured princess is on the police wanted list. The fugitive is believed to have fled to that other country located in the northern direction of our beloved teapot shaped nation. Those who confided in Blabber said she is now staying with a relative in that country. Blabber really wants our young ones to understand that money is earned, and never admire some of these big spenders in our midst when you do not know the source of their flouted wealth. Far from the madness of this unguided princess of ours, word reading Yours Truly is that there are more players in blood money acts that drove this other local businessman into kidnapping and murdering innocent people. I mean, this other businessman we blabbered about in our previous instalment who operates a few kombis and two grinding mills in that outlying high density suburb named after its prior traditional leadership. Blabber is informed that he is not the only one in the game. Blabber was promised details about this other prominent businessperson who is also unleashing a reign of terror in almost the same area. He is also into some sort of politics. Oh, by the way, Blabber was surprised to learn that some folks believe that this other boy who fell from riches to rags was only dramatising everything. They say he still has his things intact, and was just a content creator, seeking attention. For reasons best known to them, he will soon get back to his luxurious lifestyle after seeing who really cares for him and does not. Much as Blabber does not believe this line of thinking, only time will tell. We can only wait and see! Watch the space!   "

Entertainment Correspondent “HAVING noticed a lot of abandoned used tyres and car parts littering the streets, and being someone who cares for the environment, I decided to recycle the trash into useful items. “I collect worn out tyres, rims, shocks and springs, among other scraps and use them to make furniture, garden décor and novel versions of braais. Even though my core aspiration was to promote the value of recycling, lack of public education about recycling was a setback. I learnt bead work to make fashion bags and novelties, while exploring the manufacturing of cleaning products and signature essences for women and men to make up for any shortfalls in my enterprise. My bead work has become largely recognised to be of a high craftsmanship standard.” This is an inspirational tale of Beauty Dorothy Hughes, who carves beautiful artefacts through recycling ‘end of life’ worn out wares such as tyres and scrap metal. In scrap metal, she recycles worn out tractor disks, car rims and checker plates, among other things. She has also made tremendous strides in making an environmental and economic impact through responsible green business practices, while focusing on using state-of-the-art technology to increase efficiency, quality and reduce costs for end users. She believes that all output from the recycling process should be used in high-value applications— not incinerated. She dreams to open a recycling plant in Manicaland by 2030. “I am inspired to bring worn out wares back into the world. Recycling and re-purposing is in my blood. I am also into designing novelty beaded accessories from recycled plastic. Industry and manufacturers often produce more rubbish than I can actually repurpose to clean up the ever increasing environmental problems effectively. Some people are burning tyres, polluting the environment, while some are cutting down trees, harming the climate,” she said. Hughes, who owns an entity, Dollar Deals Manufacturers, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) Manicaland, in a development which will see her equipping inmates with skills and knowledge in the art, craft and design and be able to produce various artefacts. She aims to continuously innovate and apply environment friendly technologies for conversion of waste into value-added products with the aim to maximise stakeholder value. The development will play a critical role towards self- sustenance of the inmates.   She has already started the ball rolling to impart the skills.   She revealed in an interview recently that she is excited to work with the inmates. “I am happy that the organisation is growing in leaps and bounds and the partnership with ZPCS Manicaland will play a critical role in empowering the inmates. “The inmates’ passion and zeal to learn is unbelievable. It motivates me to work with them as this will help them to sustain them after serving their sentences,” she said.   Officer Commanding ZPCS in Manicaland, Commissioner Spetosomusa Chinobva, said such partnerships with stakeholders will go a long way in rehabilitating inmates.   "

Entertainment Correspondent IT was for the first time in years for masters of different music genres to share the stage before hundreds of dancing and merry-making revellers for the whole day in Mutare. The venue was Chancellor Primary School where more than 10 artistes performed at award-winning gospel musician, Dorcas Moyo’s album launch last Saturday.   The historic launch started off on a low key note around midday, but went a gear up as hundreds of people trickled later during the day. The crowd which consisted of all ages groups enjoyed every bit of the stage performances. The appearance of sungura ace, Alick Macheso further lit up the event as he had a tight schedule after performing in Murombedzi the previous night. He was billed to perform at Aquatic Complex in Chitungwiza that Saturday evening before travelling to Rusitu in Chimanimani the following day, a tight schedule that made many doubt his appearance at the event. Macheso mesmerised many with his heart-pounding bass guitar, especially on the song, Mhanza Haisekwi, a song he co-carved with Dorcas Moyo before he later posted on his Facebook page: “We had a great time in Mutare as I shared the stage with Dorcas Moyo. It was a show to remember and we will forever cherish the night.” Dendera king, Sulumani Chimbetu did not disappoint either and put the icing on the cake with a sterling performance. The crowd was also captivated by popular Kenya-based gospel musician, Fenny Kerubo, whose stage choreography was top notch. Other artistes who performed such as Carol Chidzikwe, Tinashe Murigo, Joyful Praise Choir, Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave, Mathias Mhere, Sabastian Magacha and Blessing Shumba put up top drawer performances. Zim dancehall artiste, Seh Calaz pulled up a surprise, and took the crowd into delirium after he appeared on stage to congratulate Moyo for a successful album launch. He was not part of the line-up, but he had a show elsewhere in Mutare, and made a surprise appearance. Moyo, who was elegantly dressed launched the album, Mvere Dzabvepi, in style as she performed live some of the new songs. The project carries 10 tracks that include Ngaasimudzwe Jesu, Mvere Dzabvepi, Umungwarire, featuring Sulumani Chimbetu, Muroyi Ngaafe, Africa Munoida, Segondo, featuring South-African based diva, Winnie Mashaba, Zvotoparadzana, Kumagumo, Huya Undinyaradze and Ndoimba Sei. It was engineered and produced by Olin Anderson at Kunashe Studios. The album is a cocktail of storyline. While righteousness is its fulcrum, there are lots of scintillating lines enshrined in each and every song — hypocrisy, drug abuse, and faith in God — to sum up the masterpiece. Dorcas Moyo described the event as a huge success which exceeded her expectations. “We had 99.9 percent of the lined up artistes taking up to the stage to showcase their talents. “We managed to go through and tick all the elements of the programme. Our expectations were met and we are happy about that. “The number of revellers could have been more since we were also very generous giving away complementary tickets to the general populace. “I would like to express my profound gratitude to the people of Mutare and beyond. We had people from Kariba, Bulawayo, Gweru, Harare and other places coming down. The people of Manicaland are amazing. “The confidence they showed us was just unbelievable. I want to implore my brothers and sisters that we should stick together forever,” she said.   "

Entertainment Correspondent POPULAR wheel spinner, content creator and videographer, Nyasha Tigere (35), popularly known as DJ Touch has been missing since February 12. Police and his family have launched a search for the talented disc-spinner after he last communicated on February 12. Nyasha’s mother, Spiwe Tigere said her son’s phone is not reachable.   She said they tried to contact his friends, fellow DJs and artistes to no avail. “A few days prior to his missing, we travelled to Rusape for a relative’s funeral. I called him to join us at the funeral and he promised to do so. We expected him to be at the funeral, but he later told me that he could not attend as he was busy in a recording session with a musician. I called him the following day, but he did not respond. He later texted saying he was busy in the studio and he would return my call later. “We did not panic as he would sometimes spend a day or two without coming home doing some recording sessions. We trusted that everything was fine. After spending three days without coming home in Dangamvura, we started panicking. We tried calling him, but his phone was not reachable. We made a police report in March. “We even visited Victoria Chitepo Provincial Hospital as well as their mortuary among other places in search for him. We decided to turn to the social media. “We checked with his friends, fellow DJs and musicians to no avail. We now pin our hope in God as we pray that we will see him again. We are extremely worried,” she said. Nyasha is 1.78 metres tall and weighs 87kg. He is dark in complexion. Tigere reported the matter at Mutare Central Police Station, under reference number IR 471/24. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka appealed to members of the public with information pertaining the whereabouts of the videographer to contact their nearest police station.   "

Kelly, T.I, Lil Wayne, Baby, Rick Ross and Ace Mac. This is the same line usually hurled by our brothers who would have turned into overnight millionaires as they throw money into the air in public spaces, and let the poor, in our numbers, scramble for cash on the ground. And this dear “King” of ours is one of them who used to “make it rain” when things were flowing for him. Indeed, he made money and lived a lavish lifestyle, occupying rented upmarket houses, known for their swimming pools and 50-acre lawn yards. But somehow things turned upside down, and our dear brother is now back at his mother’s house in that other overcrowded high-density suburb, where most of the residents hailed from — the city’s oldest high-density suburb.   Gentle reader, the boy is now in a sorry state! He is begging for a lift into town to the extent of seating “paKadoma.” Touts and vendors are taking turns to buy him US$1 lunch in town and these have become his friends, while those he used to roll with in the fast lane have suddenly disappeared. Blabber is also reliably informed that whatever is happening to this bozo is a direct result of supernatural money spinning charms that he possessed. Such is the uncontrolled love for money in our midst. No wonder why they say, blood may be thicker than water, but money flows deeper than both! Oh by the way, what is this that we hear about this other local businessman who is continuing with his human blood rituals for the sake of, not only making money, but also to feed his goblins. Yes, this other well-known filthy businessman who operates a small fleet of minibuses as well as two grinding mills on the outskirts of our beautiful city. Residents in that other suburb located about 20 kilometres away from the central business district, on our way to the country’s oldest city, are now scared of randomly walking at night for fear of being kidnapped. He is allegedly kidnapping people for his rituals. Ladies and gentlemen, we actually have people in our midst who allegedly lost their parents after being kidnapped and murdered by this goon, and somehow he has a way of concealing his shenanigans. Recently, there is this lady who cheated death by a whisker after almost being kidnapped by the businessman’s mercenaries. Those with ears have heard!   "

Entertainment Correspondent THE wait is finally over! The much-hyped carnival where multi award-winning gospel musician, Dorcas Moyo will be officially launching her new album is on tomorrow (Saturday). The event will be held at Chancellor Junior School, and stands as one of the biggest merriments in Manicaland so far this year, with more than 20 artistes, including Zimbabwe’s biggest names in the music industry, performing live. The album titled Mvere Dzabvepi carries 11 tracks, among them the title track, Mvere Dzabvepi, Ngaasimudzwe Jesu, Umungwarire, Muroyi Ngaafe, Ndoimba Sei and Segondo. It will feature various artistes and personalities such as Batsirai Shasha and Shugeta. The launch will be exceptional in many ways, chief among them, the expected presence of gospel musicians, Fenny Kerubo and Rose Muhando from Kenya and Tanzania, respectively. This will be Moyo’s first album launch that features the East Africa greats.    Fenny Kerubo The two divas are expected to add a unique and exciting feel to the launch.

The event starts at 11am till late. “The preparations have gathered momentum. It is not a secret that this is probably one of the biggest musical events to happen in Mutare.

His name has connotations of Malawian origin. He is not the only ‘Man of God’ doing what is least expected of him.

I mean that other pastor who was recently moved from his parish to another within the same church after several complaints were raised about his conduct. The clergy, whose name has something to do with a certain form of gasoline, is employed by that other church whose apostolic mission is predicated on firm faith.

Blabber has the names of women who exchanged blows over him as well as the identities of some married women whom he pounced on during his tenure at that parish near a ghetto bus stop, whose name has something to do with a hill.

Entertainment Correspondent IN a new and refreshing development, Manicaland which has been lagging behind in the promotion of the jazz genre and its artistes, is set to host the inaugural provincial jazz festival on April 30. It’s a new dawn for jazz music in the province as it will lead the way in the growth of the critical genre that captures the hearts of many in the global spectrum. The Manicaland Jazz Festival, which is the brainchild of National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ), will be held at Micasa Pub in the city, and six artistes are billed to headline the event. In November 2011, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) officially designated April 30 as International Jazz Day in order to highlight jazz and its diplomatic role of uniting people in all corners of the globe. International Jazz Day brings together communities, schools, artists, historians, academics, and jazz enthusiasts all over the world to celebrate and learn about jazz and its roots, future and impact; raise awareness of the need for intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding; and reinforce international cooperation and communication. NACZ Manicaland manager, Carol Makoni said all is set for the inaugural edition of the festival urging jazz music. Artistes billed to perform are Steve Chikotie, Too Open led by Brian Nhanhanga, WaCharie, Sam Mataure and Expressions Band. “We are glad that preparations of the inaugural event are at an advanced stage. All groups billed to perform are ready for the carnival which is celebrated globally. The festival will coincide with the International Jazz Day which is commemorated annually on April 30, and as Manicaland Province, we are proud to be hosting our own provincial event. The day is meant to create awareness on the importance of jazz music. The festival intends to breathe life to the jazz genre which is not very prominent in Manicaland. “Academia and veteran music education teacher, Tendekayi Kuture, who is a retired music lecturer from Africa University, will do a presentation on the history of jazz music and its evolution to the different forms which are being played nowadays,” said Makoni.    Brian Nhanganga Micasa proprietor and co-organiser of the event, Tich Shoniwa said it is all systems go. “It is our pleasure to host the inaugural edition of the festival. Jazz is one of the most sought after genres across the globe and it is a great development to honour the day with some performances.” The lineup is a blend of upcoming and veteran jazz musicians. Brian Nhanhanga, who is now based in Mabvuku where he is also a producer, boasts of more than 30 years in the music industry. He is the leader of Afro-jazz group, Too Open, popularly known for performing own compositions as well as cover songs. One of the major highlights of his career was when he played with Ragga Manyika outfit, Assegai Crew, from 1994 to 1996, and recorded the hit album, Zvese Mari, which contains the plug track, Mai Bhoyi. Born in Mutare’s oldest ghetto of Sakubva’s New Chisamba section, Nhanhanga became popular after releasing the chartbuster, Matida Hostel, on the album Zororo. He has promised to put up a sterling performance. “I am glad to be part of the line-up. It is a perfect reunion with jazz lovers in Mutare, and we would like to thank the organisers for honouring the genre with such an event,” he said.
Chikotie, who is a tried and tested jazz musician, said the inaugural fest was a long over-due initiative. “This is a milestone to jazz music in Manicaland. This is a genre that deserves more recognition. I promise to put up a memorable performance,” he said   "

Post Correspondent THE year 1992 was a unique dispensation in the country’s entertainment domain. It was the year when one of the finest songs ever to emerge from the Zimbabwean showbiz was coined. The song is irresistible and anthemic in night clubs, at public gatherings, weddings, parties and public transport. The song – dubbed Murambinda – was carved by the late legendary and iconic wordsmith, Paul Mpofu and Zambuko Band. It is sad that death snatched such a unique and creative wordsmith from our midst. He left when people were beginning to appreciate his music and talent.   The song was famous for its well-arranged instruments, neatly-crafted lyrics, excellent chord progression, perfect blending of vocals and instruments. One of the special attributes that make a song good is its ability to evoke a specific emotion of feeling. It was and it is a danceable, yet unique piece of art with a jiti feel. Murambinda is a timeless classic. It is a love song.   It is a stern warning to a jealousy rival suitor who tries to woo a friend’s wife by flashing a glitzy life of, among other things, putting on fancy and expensive clothes whenever he visits his home. In the song, Mpofu advised the rival suitor to desist from such cunning acts, and leave his apple of the eye alone or else it would end in tears. Mpofu chronicled an arduous journey he undertook from the then dusty village of Murambinda in Buhera District of Manicaland, where he ‘scouted’ his newly-found and unpolished diamond and travelled to settle with her in Harare. As the song nears its end, and still in its danceable manner, Mpofu equated the song to ‘honey’. Murambinda, back then was just a small and dusty growth point situated in a communal district of Buhera. Fast forward to 2024, Murambinda is now a town and everything that is obtaining in this settlement now bears testimony to this. Everything happening there is now designed to transform it into a modern, smart and inclusive urban settlement. New buildings are now being approved on the basis of how they help beautify the town and planners are now working on its attractiveness so that it evolves within the parameters of the smart city. Town status is a journey on its own — and now that Murambinda is a town, efforts are being made to make it a technologically driven settlement with efficient transport and energy systems. Granting of town status is done through Section 4(1)(a) of the Urban Councils Act, and Presidential proclamation. Murambinda has a strong footing, given that it is coming from an entirely communal background, with the land being turned into State land and being incorporated into its boundaries. This means land is basically cheaper as the town board will only compensate for improvements and not the land itself.   A population of about 15 000 people are so far settled at Murambinda. On reflection, one wonders what could have inspired Mpofu to come up with Murambinda, of all growth points in the country, as the title of his song. The Manica Post this week tracked down the producer of the song, Bothwell Nyamhondera – a man with 40 years of experience in the music production industry. “It was and still a very popular song. After its release, the song shook the nation. It was like a national anthem. “The guitars were unique and well arranged. He was a unique and very creative artiste. Although Mpofu did not divulge much on what inspired him to come up with the song, he was a creative storyteller who often tackled issues that affected people’s day-to-day lives like love, betrayal, marriage and hate, among other things. Back then love songs would not struggle to penetrate the market and become instant hits. “And Murambinda was just what the doctor had prescribed, and now that the Independence Day celebrations are being held at Murambinda, it will be befitting to have this great and legendary musician honoured for popularising the growth point through such an anthemic song,” said Nyamhondera. The publication also caught up with Paul Mpofu Junior, who has inherited his father’s rich musical heritage. Mpofu Jnr, who is now a drummer at Alick Macheso’s Orchestra Mberikwazvo, said although his daddy is late, his memory is still perched in the legions of his followers. “I was just eight-years-old when he died. I was later told that my father was a storyteller and sometimes his lyrics were inspired by dreams. That song Murambinda is a piece of art and the story never involved my parents. Unlike what most people thought, my mother does not come from Murambinda.
My mum would always say my father was also an avid reader, and he loved reading Shona poems. She also said he would craft a song by merely looking at nature or people at a shopping centre,” said Mpofu Jnr.   "
