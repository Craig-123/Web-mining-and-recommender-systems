Cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, Dr Wilfred Muteweye told The Herald in an interview that rheumatic heart disease cases are the most common condition they have operated on. “The most common heart disease that we operate on is rheumatic heart disease (RHD). This is when the heart valves are damaged over time due to the body’s reaction to a throat infection,” he said. “Initially the patient has a throat infection in childhood. As the body mobilises the immune system to fight that infection, the antibodies against the infection start to damage the heart valve tissue. The damaged valves then deteriorate overtime (10 – 25 years), resulting in an abnormally functioning heart (and lungs in some cases). The patient then develops chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue, among other symptoms. “Our job is to remove the diseased valve and put in an artificial one. This, if done early enough, will allow for the reversal of symptoms and allow the patient to live life to the full, to have a life expectancy similar to any other people in the population.” This condition arises as valves become damaged due to inflammation in the heart tissue. Experts say the heart valves are important to ensure blood flows through the heart smoothly. They also help prevent the backflow of blood. Damage to the heart valves can cause serious health conditions. Zimbabwean cardiac specialists resumed open heart surgeries early this year. They are targeting to perform 60 free open heart surgeries this year as they scale up efforts to significantly reduce the backlog of people needing treatment. As of December 2023, the team had conducted 22 open heart surgeries. Out of these, three patients died while 19 recovered well. In the first quarter of 2024, Zimbabwean surgeons conducted nine successful heart operations at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, one of the country’s largest referral hospitals. “For 2024, we started at the end of January. We have conducted surgery on nine patients,” Dr Muteweye said. “We currently have three patients at Parirenyatwa Hospital who are recovering from the surgeries. One of them had two valves, which we replaced. She is almost ready for discharge.” Worldwide, about 20 million people suffer from RHD, according to the World Health Organisation. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region in the world and in Southern Africa, 17 out of 1 000 people suffer from RHD. “Heart valve surgery is the only relief for most of them. Sadly, not many Sub – Saharan countries offer cardiac surgery. In addition, cardiac surgeons are in short supply. The ratio of cardiac surgeons to the general population in Africa is ome surgeon per 5 million people, while in the West it is one surgeon per 50 – 100 000 people. In Zimbabwe, we are slightly better than other African countries with one surgeon per 3 million people,” Dr Muteweye said. He said rheumatic heart disease conditions could be prevented through early treatment of childhood throat infections with antibiotics and reducing overcrowding. People more at risk of these infections are in large crowded places such as schools, day care centres or colleges. Anyone can develop rheumatic fever, but it is more common in children aged five to 15 years and it is very rare in children younger than three years old as well as adults. Rheumatic heart disease symptoms vary depending on the severity and extent of the damage to the heart valve. Health experts say in some cases, there may be no symptoms, while in others, they may include pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, swelling of the stomach, hands or feet, fatigue, rapid or irregular heartbeat.

Provincial police spokesperson, Inspector Milton Mundembe said the deceased, Last Mutematsaka, is the accused, Kero Dick’s uncle. Inspector Mundembe said on April 22 this year at around 3 pm, Dick’s mother, Eriza Chiunye (45), drove a herd of cattle into Mutematsaka’s sorghum field. A furious Mutematsaka exchanged words with Chiunye. She went home and told her son about the altercation. Armed with an iron bar, Dick, who was intoxicated, confronted Mutematsaka, accusing him of insulting his mother. He struck Mutematsaka several times on the stomach and groin until he became unconscious. His wife, Maria Chipiwe, rushed Mutematsaka to Chikafa Clinic where he was treated and discharged. The following day, Mutematsaka’s condition deteriorated and he was rushed to Chitsungo Hospital. He died on April 24. Inspector Mundembe appealed to members of the public to solve their differences amicably and avoid resorting to violence. “People need to seek the assistance of mediators or report to the police whenever they face some challenges in resolving disputes,” he said.

The team behind the initiative include Mr Mark Chunga, the founder; Ms Wadzanai Majuru, the operations manager; Ms Natasha Machingura, the programs manager and Mr Munyaradzi Edmore Kashiri, the finance manager. Emphasising on the importance of collaboration, the group has formed partnerships with various organisations and schools to support children with neurological disorders. The disorders, often characterised by a range of physical and cognitive impairments, present substantial challenges for affected children and their families. While these conditions cannot be cured, the youth-led initiative seeks to enhance the affected children’s quality of life through a variety of projects and support systems. Speaking at a press conference over the weekend in Harare, Mr Chunga said the organisation has plans to expand their reach beyond Harare. Their goal is to reach and help as many children with neurological disorders as possible, irrespective of their location. “We have initiated various projects to support and finance this important cause, including a chicken rearing project. Our mission is to bring comfort and relief to the lives of these children and their families, and we are dedicated to making a meaningful impact in their lives,” said Mr Chunga. So far, the Charity Project has distributed wheelchairs, donated food and other items to affected children. The group’s unwavering dedication to this cause has attracted attention and support from various quarters, with many expressing admiration for the selfless initiative taken by these young people. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/zimbabwe-records-nine-open-heart-surgeries-in-first-quarter/,Zimbabwe records nine open-heart surgeries in first quarter,"Sifelani Tsiko Innovations Editor Zimbabwe cardiac specialists have resumed open-heart surgeries at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in the capital, with nine patients benefitting in the first quarter of the year.   Veteran cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, Dr Wilfred Muteweye recently told The Herald that his team has recorded steady progress and is optimistic of realising this year’s target of 60 patients.   “For 2024, we started at the end of January. Just this year we have done nine patients so far. Despite some challenges here and there, I am quite optimistic that we may soon be doing two cases per week once we get reliable and consistent supplies,” he said.   “We are building up gradually. We have been doing one open-heart surgery per week for the past few weeks,” said Dr Muteweye.   Zimbabwean cardiac specialists are targeting to perform 60 free open-heart surgeries this year as they scale up efforts to significantly reduce the backlog of people needing treatment.   As of December 2023, the team had conducted 22 open-heart surgeries. Out of this, three patients died while 19 recovered well.   “We currently have three patients at Parirenyatwa Hospital who are recovering from the surgeries. One of them had two valves replaced. She is almost ready for discharge,” Dr Muteweye said.   “Government continues to support us. None of our patients are paying for the surgeries. We are planning to start doing open-heart surgery for children this year, probably by August,” he said.   Zimbabwe resumed open-heart surgery at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals last year in June after the service was stopped in 2018.   From that year upto 2023, patients in need of open-heart surgery had to fork out huge sums of money to seek treatment in South Africa, India, Kenya, Italy, Sudan and other countries.   A heart operation in India costs anything between US$8 000 to US$15 000, depending on the complexity of the case.   On the other hand, the surgeries being conducted in Zimbabwe are done free of charge.   The country has between 500 and 600 adult patients with rheumatic heart disease awaiting surgery, while every year about 4 000 children are born with congenital heart deformities that need open-heart surgery.   “We have the capacity to conduct these operations and even more complex heart surgeries. We are gradually building our capacity and our team is becoming more efficient,” Dr Muteweye said.   “The operation times are now shorter, that is the time when the patient is on the operating table. The patient’s average stay in the intensive care unit has also become shorter,” he said.   Zimbabwe has a history of heart operations that dates back to 1959.   The first case of an open-heart surgery in Zimbabwe was reported in 1959 when two surgeons, Dr NJ Micklem and Dr GVS Wright, used external body cooling methods to conduct a successful operation on a 15-year-old boy who had a diseased pulmonary valve.   In the 1970s and 1980s, a philanthropic team from Loma Linda University, United States, visited Zimbabwe and did open heart surgeries.   From 1988 to 1992, a local team of specialists was set up to do operations. The open-heart surgery programme became a permanent feature from 1994, run by Dr David Chimuka and Dr William Mahalu and a few others.   However, the programme ceased in 2003 due to lack of foreign currency to purchase consumables after more than 400 patients had benefited.   According to a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with more than 19 million deaths reported every year.   Globally, heart disease-rElated deaths increased from 12,4 million in 1990 to 19,8 million in 2022.   Health experts say the Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East regions are estimated to have the highest burden of deaths due to heart related diseases, with high blood pressure, raised cholesterol, dietary risks and air pollution being the leading causes.

https://www.herald.co.zw/government-launches-digital-cross-border-permits-and-comesa-licenses/,Government launches digital cross border permits and COMESA licenses,"Freeman Razemba Senior Reporter Government has launched digital cross border permits and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) carrier licenses for passenger and transport operators to facilitate the smooth and unimpeded flow of cross-border traffic between countries. The new ICT system for processing these permits and licenses is fully integrated with the Central Vehicle Registry to validate vehicle licensing and registration details. In a statement yesterday, Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona confirmed the development. “Pursuant to the objectives of National Development Strategy 1 and the utility of digitalization as an enabler of economic development across the broad spectrum of growth factors, including in transportation, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development wishes to advise the public of the launch of the digital Cross Border Permits and COMESA Carrier Licenses for passenger and freight transport operators with effect from Thursday 9 May, 2024. “A digital Cross Border Permit is issued in terms of Article 4 of the Bilateral Road Transport Agreements signed between Zimbabwe and SADC Member States. Similarly, a COMESA Carrier License is issued in terms of Article 85 of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa Treaty. The Bilateral Road Transport Agreements and the COMESA Treaty are meant to facilitate the smooth and unimpeded flow of cross-border traffic between countries,” he said. He said the digital Cross Border Permits and COMESA Carrier Licenses have enhanced security features. “Consequently, as a counterfeit deterrence measure, these permits and licenses have a digitally signed barcode which is readable by any mobile device. It is now easier for both local and regional traffic law enforcement agents to verify and validate their authenticity. “Our new ICT system for processing these permits and licenses is fully integrated with the Central Vehicle Registry to validate vehicle licensing and registration details. This system is also integrated with insurance companies to validate statutory third-party motor insurance and passenger liability cover. “This will enhance the ease of doing business for transport operators who will enjoy the convenience of reduced waiting times when they apply for the new permits and licenses issued at our Road Motor Transportation Offices situated in all the provincial centres across the country,” Minister Mhona said.

https://www.herald.co.zw/zim-to-become-africas-fertiliser-production-hub/,Zim to become Africa’s fertiliser production hub,"Zvamaida Murwira recently in NAIROBI, Kenya Zimbabwe is set to be an African hub of fertiliser production, research and training after the African Union Summit resolved to rejuvenate and capacitate the African Centre for Fertiliser Development in Harare, President Mnangagwa has said. The centre was set up in Harare by the continental body in the 1980s to boost research, training and production, but has been dormant. It established in Zimbabwe through an AU protocol to train, provide technological transfer, support research and demonstrate the role of fertiliser to improve agriculture and fertiliser management practices. It also seeks to provide support to the fertiliser sector in Africa and coordinate projects at national, regional and international levels in the adaptation, testing and demonstration of improved fertiliser production. President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe stood to benefit immensely from the rejuvenation of the continental centre. He was speaking in an interview with Zimbabwean journalists at the conclusion of the African Fertiliser and Soil Health Summit in Nairobi last week. The summit drew Heads of State and Government from the continent. African leaders resolved to fully use the centre in Zimbabwe to stop dependence on the global North, from where the continent is importing the bulk of its fertiliser, spending billions of US dollars in the process. Said the President: “It has been there. It was an AU decision a long time back. “It has been dormant, in my view, but now the rest of Africa has realised that it is necessary to capacitate it, that is to provide funding from the AU to make sure that it provides services for which it was created and I am happy that we host the continental centre.” President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe, just like other African countries, has been lagging behind in terms of optimum fertiliser use and soil management. “We are behind, as I was listening to what is required, we always thought that application of fertiliser is normal, year after year. It is not like that, the soil itself gets aged, fertiliser cannot continue to be the same, it must continue to be improved, depending on the climate and soil of a particular region. “This is what we are learning and fortunately Zimbabwe is the centre for the continent, as a fertiliser centre, and now we are going to give more focus to make sure we recruit the expertise in that field to ensure that our centre delivers for the purpose of which it was set up.” The President described the summit, which ended last Thursday, as an eye -opener. “This summit brought together Heads of State and Government primarily to deal with the question of agriculture, and, in particular, we now realise that soil requires attention. “We have always thought that soil is soil, But we now realise that it has to be treated like individuals, like persons; this is what the conference was all about, to rejuvenate our soils so that they continue to give us better yields. “Yes, of course, in the past, people in many countries used fertiliser and so on, but it goes beyond just using fertiliser; we are now told that it requires health attention like human beings. “This is an eye opener and fortunately we had our Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Dr Anxious Masuka. I am sure he has benefited from the presentations that were made.” Addressing Heads of State and Government, President Mnangagwa welcomed the decision to revamp the centre, which he described as a critical cog in promoting research on soil health and fertiliser development. “We, thus, welcome the commitment to fully operationalise and support the Africa Centre for Fertiliser Development, which was the brainchild of our august body and whose strategic mandate is aligned with the agenda of this summit,” he said. African Union Commission chairperson Mr Moussa Faki Mahamat said it was sad that the continent continued to import fertiliser, yet it had a centre in Zimbabwe which was not being fully used. “Regarding fertiliser, it constitutes a critical input for productivity if properly used. In terms of fertiliser use, Africa is below the global average, hence the meeting in Abuja which set 50kg per hectare per year. Some African countries produce fertiliser but we depend mostly on imported fertiliser, making it very expensive for our farmers yet the African Centre for Fertiliser Development based in Zimbabwe has been in existence since the 1980s. “We must optimise use of such existing continental assets to boost local fertiliser production and deliver to our farmers at affordable prices,” he said. “This is imperative if we are to improve the continent’s agricultural sector, which is key for our sovereignty and security.” In an interview, Minister Masuka said one of the summit’s resolutions was a declaration to integrate the centre, which is a fertiliser coordination mechanism platform, to become one of the AU organs. “You remember in 1981 (the then) Organisation of African Unity established a fertiliser coordination mechanism at continental level, the Africa Centre for Fertiliser Development, which Zimbabwe proudly hosted. “Eight countries have ratified, 33 countries have signed for it but it is not functioning as a continental institution and one of the declarations coming out of this conference is the full integration of this Pan-African institution into the main AU body, so that it can deliver the necessary research and development, also the capacitation that is required to ensure sustainable increase in the use of organic and inorganic fertiliser and the use of soil health,” said Minister Masuka. The summit, which ran under the theme “Listen to the Land”, had outcomes that include a 10-year action plan to deliver concrete action for steps to be taken by African leaders and stakeholders. The action plan will focus on new policies and investments that will enable farmers to work towards re-building soil health and ultimately increase yield responses and profitability. The summit came after the first held in 2006 in Abuja, Nigeria, which endorsed the Abuja Declaration on Fertiliser for the Africa Green Revolution, a continental strategy to reverse the trend of poor productivity of African soils.

https://www.herald.co.zw/sa-e-passports-start-this-week/,SA e-passports start this week,"Blessings Chidakwa Herald Reporter Zimbabwe starts processing e-passports at its embassy in South Africa this week, with officers from the Registrar General’s department being deployed to assist consulate staff. As the Government continues to make strides in making civic documents readily available and easy to access, the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry has completed the setting up of the e-passport processing centre in Johannesburg. Plans are afoot to open five more e-passport offices abroad, including in the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and the US. The Second Republic is walking the talk on bringing services closer to the people, locally and abroad. In an interview, Permanent Secretary for Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, Ambassador Raphael Faranisi, said all was in place to start the issue of e-passports in South Africa from this week. “Staff from the registrar’s office will this week be travelling to our South African Embassy to train the consulate staff on how to process e-passports. “The Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry was doing renovations at the consulate, but it is now complete. So, this week, while training the consulate staff, they will also be issuing the e-passports.” Within two weeks, issuing e-passports would be in full swing. Ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage will officially commission the office on a date to be announced. The Government has opened several e-passport centres countrywide including in Guruve, Gwanda, Gweru, Lupane, Marondera, Beitbridge, Chitungwiza, Hwange, Mazowe, Murehwa, Zvishavane, Chinhoyi and Guruve, to add to the facilities at Chiwashira Muchecheterwa Building in Harare and at provincial and district offices in Bulawayo. Issuance of e-passports began on January 18 2022, as the civil registry department took heed of the Government’s directive to smoothen the process of acquiring travel documents, which, until then, was a nightmare for many people. The launch of the e-passport and the state-of-the-art passport enrolment centre, is in line with the Government’s vision of a modern and digitised economy. Strategic investment in key areas of the digital economy is seen as a critical way for Zimbabwe to keep pace with the dynamic and technological environment. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/vp-chiwenga-mourns-farmer-swanepoel/,VP Chiwenga mourns farmer Swanepoel,"Fidelis Munyoro Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga has sent a message of condolence to the Swanepoel family following the passing on of veteran farmer, Mr Nick Swanepoel, who died in South Africa last week. Last  night, VP Chiwenga said he, together with his wife Colonel Miniyothabo Chiwenga and staff from his office join President Mnangagwa in mourning Mr Swanepoel. He described Mr Swanepoel as a farmer of repute and a fine gentleman who served Mashonaland West Province and the nation at large with distinction. “He belonged to a rare breed of former farm owners who took it upon themselves to selflessly negotiate with the Government, culminating in the signing of the Global Compensation Deed, which provided a lasting solution to the land question in Zimbabwe,” he said. Mr Nick Swanepoel worked well with  VP Chiwenga in the Joint Resources Mobilisation Committee and his contribution to this noble national cause will solely be missed. “We shall forever cherish the moments we spent with him and remain indebted to him for his selfless contribution to the development of our great nation. To the Swanepoel family, please accept our heartfelt condolences.” Mr Swanepoel played a key and progressive role in the search for a cordial, negotiated settlement to the Zimbabwean land question, according to President Mnangagwa in his condolence message last Friday. President Mnangagwa extolled Mr Swanepoel’s level-headedness and the role he played when Zimbabwe corrected the skewed land distribution, which favoured white settlers to the detriment of native Zimbabweans. Mr Swanepoel was a long-time leader of the Commercial Farmers Union from the year 2000 when the struggle for the recovery of land entered a decisive phase. He and like-minded progressive white farmers kept their heads and tirelessly pushed for a non-confrontational and non-political approach to the land question, even calling for the removal of the then right-wing CFU executive led by Mr Tim Henwood, which they correctly saw as an obstacle to a just resolution of the land question. President Mnangagwa implored the nation to recommit to the vision of a non-racial society as the country mourns and remembers Mr Swanepoel, a great figure of post-independence racial conciliation through just settlement. All Zimbabweans, he added, should deepen and entrench the vision for a just, non-racial society in which colour, creed or tribe never count or matter in daily lives and engagements. After a successful land reform, the Government under the leadership of President Mnangagwa, signed the agreement that committed to compensate white ex-farmers up to US$3,5 billion for land developments.

https://www.herald.co.zw/govt-to-ease-forex-exchange-challenges-through-agents/,Govt to ease forex exchange challenges through agents,"Trust Freddy Herald Correspondent People should soon be able to access bureaux de change for small foreign exchange transactions at the official exchange rate and the Government plans to allow the return of mobile wallet agents as part of ongoing efforts to promote the use of the electronic ZiG and to ensure legal foreign currency trading. Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Deputy Minister, Mr David Mnangagwa, told Parliament last week that Government was working closely with the private sector to facilitate small transactions, allowing citizens to access foreign currency legally and conveniently. This follows the suspension of more than 4 000 EcoCash agents in 2020 on allegations of participating in the then rampant trend of charging excessive premiums for customers intending to cash in their mobile money. He announced the change in policy in the Senate last week while responding to Senators’ queries on measures taken by the Government to address illegal foreign currency trading. “We are working on a solution as Government, coupled with the private sector, to allow for small transactions, that is the general populace to be able to get the small amounts, $20 or $50, through negotiations with our mobile network operators to be able to access the bureaux de change that are on their EcoCash or Netcash platforms. “This means if you have an Econet line and if you register for EcoCash, you can convert from ZiG to US dollars, or from US dollars to ZiG at the official exchange rate. That is the first part to allow interchangeability without having to go to the streets,” the Deputy Minister said. This move is expected to promote financial inclusion, reduce reliance on the black market for the small transactions and increase the use of electronic ZiG. The plan, the Deputy Minister said, also involved reactivating EcoCash agents across the country, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that everyone had access to legal foreign currency. “The second part is, we are still in discussion. Right now, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is talking to the mobile network operators, mentioning Econet in particular because they were suspended in 2020 after some issues that now have been ironed   out. “We would want to have agents reactivated so that the most remote areas, our constituents, the citizenry can access both US dollars and ZiG from their wallets. “Econet went a step further last week and zero-rated the charges for sending money from parts of the diaspora to Zimbabwe. This was a show of good faith and support for Government during this El Nino period as well as to show the commitment in bolstering our efforts in supporting and defending.” "

Amai Mnangagwa’s long-term commitment, as the country’s health and child care ambassador, to improve access to quality health care by vulnerable groups through technology and enhancing women economic empowerment saw her facilitate the establishment of a community e-commerce and e-health centre at Maria Theresa Clinic. A clinic which she built using her personal resources and named it after her late mother. The e-health initiative at Maria Theresa now enables community members to go through virtual medical consultations, receive accurate diagnoses and get prescriptions without the need to travel long distances. The First Lady also donated a vehicle and electric bicycle cart to Maria Theresa and Rosa hospital also received an electric bicycle cart courtesy of the Angel of Hope Foundation and its partners which will be used to pay home visits and deliver medicine to the elderly and patients in hard to reach area. Amai Mnangagwa also handed over two top notch vehicles donated by President Mnangagwa to Kakora Primary and Secondary Schools where she received her education. The First Lady is motivated by her desire to meet the needs of less privileged people and she has continued advocating for their upliftment as she was raised in a similar background. Her wish and passion stems from the way she grew up in a child-headed family, with her being the second child. Amai Mnangagwa’s dreams are to see a better life for the vulnerable groups and less-privileged communities. True to the name of her organisation, the First Lady has been an angel of hope who is devoting time and resources to ensure those in marginalised communities are not forgotten.  Former legislators Dr Sekai Nzenza (left), Cde Joseph Chinotimba and Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe chairperson Dr Tafadzwa Musarara follow proceedings during the launch of the e-health and e-commerce centres in Mashonaland Central province Through the newly launched e-health facility, a patient in Chiweshe had a medical consultation with a doctor in Mutare and received treatment virtually courtesy of the tele-medicine facility, which connects a patient with any doctor worldwide. In her address, the First Lady went down memory lane, narrating her upbringing while taking time to appreciate the community that raised. All she could say was, “Thank you”, as the villagers cheered, ululated and whistled. Amai Mnangagwa said Kakora village played a crucial role in her upbringing and moulding her into the person she is today along with her siblings among them Chief Negomo. “I was born at Rossa Hospital. I went to Kakora Primary School wearing slip-ons. Life was difficult after both parents passed on,” she said. “The community assisted us to be where we are today. For me to learn how to read and write it started at Kakora Primary School.” Amai Mnangagwa said the donated vehicles were a gift from President Mnangagwa, a token of appreciation to the Kakora village. There were exhibition stands which were mounted among them one from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The First Lady encouraged Zimbabweans to embrace and protect the new currency. “Let us protect our money, our economy is on the rebound. Gold doesn’t turn rusty it remains gold so our currency must be the same,” she said.  TV personality Oscar Pambuka who was rehabilitated from drug and substance abuse gives his testimony on the dangers after an invitation by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa during an interactive session with the youths at Kakora village in Chiweshe A former drug and substance victim, and television personality Oscar Pambuka, was invited by Amai Mnangagwa to give inspirational message against drug and substance abuse. He thanked the First Lady for giving him another chance to be a better person. Pambuka said he joined the national broadcaster, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, in 2000 and in 2016, he started using crystal meth until his arrest last year. “From wearing suits and reading the news to drug addiction, my incarceration became my turning point. Parents, when you see your children isolating themselves be inquisitive, drug abuse is real,” he said. “I thank the First Lady for listening to my plight and speaking passionately against drug and substance abuse. Your voice is powerful when it comes to drug and substance abuse, Amai. Tinokutendai sevana venyu,” he said. Kakora Primary School head Ms Tendayi Mushore said she was overjoyed, expressing her heartfelt gratitude to President Mnangagwa and the First Lady for always remembering them. “We previously faced transport challenges, but with this generous gift, we will now be able to travel effortlessly, conducting school business and transporting children to sports competitions without the need to hire a car. This vehicle will be a valuable asset for our school. “At the same time, I would like to extend our deepest appreciation to His Excellency, President Mnangagwa, for supporting Amai to remember us. “Our First Lady has always been a big pillar of strength for our school, and today we are proud to boast a world-class computer lab, equipped with 42 laptops, a projector, and a whiteboard, making our children’s education a seamless experience,” she said.  Vehicles that were donated by President Mnangagwa to Kakora Primary and Secondary schools, former schools of First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa Kakora Primary School Development Committee chairperson Ms Eunice Mhondiwa said Amai Mnangagwa was a fountain of humility, love and kindness. “We are thrilled to receive these cars. It is always a pleasure to receive support from the President and our mother. We promise to use the vehicles wisely and handle them with care, as they are vital tools for our schools.” Ms Mhondiwa said this was not the first time the President and Amai had supported them, and appreciate their continued kindness. “We are also excited that our children are attending a school that our First Lady attended, and we hope they will grow up to become accomplished individuals just like her. “We are delighted that she always remembers her roots and continues to support our community,” she said. Mrs Nelia Shumba nee-Negomo also showered the First Lady with praises. “We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the First Lady for her tireless charity work. She founded the Angel of Hope Foundation, which cares for the vulnerable groups and we are extremely proud of her selfless efforts. We take great pride in her compassion and generosity. “We pray to God to grant her many more years of life, so she can continue her remarkable charity work. Her kindness extends far beyond her home village, as she supports numerous people across the country,” she said.

Gloria Muruva The proposed amendments to the Deposit Protection Corporation Act will prioritise the compensation of ordinary depositors over institutional debtors in the event of bank failures, acting Deposit Protection Corporation chief executive, Ms Kiitumetsi Zawanda told Parliamentarians last week. Speaking at a breakfast meeting with legislators from the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion last Friday she updated them on the amendments to the Deposit Protection Corporation Act. The Deposit Protection Corporation was established in 2003 to compensate depositors from losses incurred in the event of bank failures. “The current Act ranks depositors who are the unsophisticated people from the constituencies and so forth not as high as we would want them to be. You find that statutory creditors like Zimra, Zimdef and NSSA were ranked higher in terms of creditors of the bank than (ordinary) depositors. “So, we thought to fix that because Zimra does have powers to pursue the bank, while it’s still alive so why should we be giving them preference at that stage when we can protect the unsophisticated and innocent depositor instead,” she said. Ms Zawanda said the proposed amendments would also ensure that shareholders of formerly insolvent institutions do not benefit from any currency changes or inflation that may result in them becoming solvent. “You find that some liabilities, five to 10 years ago were in US dollars and some changes happened in the economy and that liability became Zimbabwe dollar. “This change of value gave an advantage to some of the shareholders because there comes a point where there is a residue because of a movement of inflation and they gain because of those movements. “We found ourselves with residue and the law currently states that residue has to be returned to shareholders so these are some of the things we are trying to address in the current amendments so that what was once an insolvent institution does not fortuitously become solvent because of operation of economic fundamentals,” she added. Deposit Protection Corporation chairman, Mr Agmos Moyo said the Act was important in protecting depositors. “The Depositors Protection Corporation Act plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the interests of depositors and maintaining confidence in our banking institutions. “The Deposit Protection Corporation’s job is to be a soft landing for the depositors in the event of a bank failure. By providing a safety net for depositors in the event of a bank failure, this legislation is essential for promoting financial stability and protecting the savings of individuals and businesses across Zimbabwe,” he said. The chairman of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance and Economic Development and Investment Promotion Cde Clemence Chiduwa said amendments to the Act were essential in protecting the depositors and maintaining trust in the banking and financial services sector. “One of the primary reasons why amending the deposit protection laws is crucial is to safeguard depositors’ funds. In the event of a bank failure or financial crisis, depositors should have confidence that their money is safe and will be reimbursed up to a certain limit. “By enhancing deposit protection laws, we can instil trust in the banking system and encourage more people to save and invest their money, ultimately promoting economic growth and stability,” he said. Cde Chiduwa said maintaining a robust deposit protection framework was essential for maintaining financial stability within the country, in times of economic uncertainty or banking crises. A lack of adequate deposit insurance could lead to widespread panic withdrawals, bank runs and systemic risks. Other proposed amendments to the law include enhanced use of ICTs in deposit protection to cut out travel by ordinary people to prove their claims, representation of depositors on the Depositors Protection Corporation board and protection of assets of failed institutions from theft by unscrupulous shareholders among others. The country experienced at least nine bank failures in the 2000s as many of the newly licenced banks ran into major trouble, often with executives and shareholders becoming major borrowers. The new banks run properly not only survived the turmoil, but in some cases have become leaders of the sector. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/sugar-shortage-fears-allayed/,Sugar shortage fears allayed,"Zimbabwe has enough sugar for the domestic market, and even has surplus to export, despite shortages experienced in the country, a sugar industry expert said on Thursday. Zimbabwe Sugar Association Experiment Station senior agriculture and industrial research chemist Dr Washington Mutatu said the public must not panic over any temporary shortage since there was enough sugar cane ready for harvest. “I think currently we are producing enough sugar cane to produce sugar which should be able to supply our domestic market and for export. So consumers should not be worried about the availability of sugar, it’s actually available,” he said. Exports were not going to be stripping the local market since Zimbabwean sugar was uncompetitive because of the high production costs of electricity, water, fertiliser and labour. “Our cost of production is very high, so as scientists we have to investigate ways and methods of reducing the cost of production,” said Dr Mutatu. He wanted to see sugar producers diversity into manufacture of more sugar by-products to improve their revenue streams. Some of the by-products of sugar are ethanol, fuels and molasses. – Ziana. "

Archbishop Masuka, who was leader of the Zion Apostolic Church – 1923, died last Friday on his way to Masvingo General Hospital following a road accident. He was 50. Reverend Kamupira, who was chaplain-general at Nyaradzo Funeral Services, died at a local clinic in Harare on Saturday. In a condolence message, Pastors 4ED national chairperson Prophetess Idirashe Dongo yesterday said they were saddened by the passing on of the “patriotic” clergymen. “It is with profound sorrow and a heavy heart that as Pastors for Economic Development, we extend our deepest condolences to the families, friends, and members of the church community on the passing of our esteemed bishops who loved their country,” said Prophetess Dongo. “Their departure has left a void in our hearts and in the spiritual leadership of our nation. “The Bishops were pillars of faith, beacons of light in times of darkness and shepherds who led their flock with unwavering commitment and divine wisdom.” Prophetess Dongo said the religious leaders dedicated their lives to the service of the Lord and the betterment of their congregants, touching countless lives through their ministries. “As we mourn their loss, we also celebrate their remarkable legacy; a legacy of love, service and unshakable faith.” “They taught us the importance of compassion, the power of prayer and the infinite grace of forgiveness. Their teachings and example have left an indelible mark on our community and will continue to guide us in the path of righteousness. “In this time of grief, we find solace in the scriptures, which remind us that ‘Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted’ (Matthew 5:4). We take comfort in knowing that our beloved Bishops are now in the glorious presence of our Heavenly Father, receiving the reward for their faithful service,” she said. Prophetess Dongo called on the church in Zimbabwe to come together in unity and support one another as during this period of bereavement. "
