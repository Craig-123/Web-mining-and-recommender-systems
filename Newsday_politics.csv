                     Mthuli: The anti-devolution face
                    ","THE Zanu PF administration is against devolution and its actions of late confirm that its agreement to devolution clauses were just to get the new Constitution passed. The inclusive government of 2009 to 2013, after the disputed 2008 presidential polls, had a task to produce a new governing charter for Zimbabwe. It should be remembered that the process was nominally led by Parliament and was being driven by the Executive — the principals. Parliament, at the time, consisted of Zanu PF and two factions of the opposition MDC party — one led by Morgan Tsvangirai and the other by Welshman Ncube. The MDCs had a 10-seat majority in Parliament and for the first time Zanu PF experienced what it feels like to be in opposition or running a minority government. Minority governments are a phenomenon of the Westminster parliamentary system. Zanu PF was a minority in Parliament, but the President was from the party. It meant that the party had to build consensus on any policy decisions before they were announced. The constitutional review process was done in the spirit of the triumvirate, Zanu PF and the two MDC formations. It is clear and supported by multiple independent and reliable sources that the two big parties in the coalition — Zanu PF and Tsvangirai-led MDC were not keen on devolution. The Ncube-led MDC was the only one seriously concerned about devolution. There are a number of reasons why the parties took these positions. Zanu PF and Tsvangirai-led MDC had the potential to win a national election and thus form a strong central government. Meanwhile, the Ncube-led MDC was more of a provincial/regional political entity and its success could only be seen in the area they were likely to win, hence it needed some power to control the affairs in areas it won elections. It is now 11 years after Zanu PF won the 2013 elections, the first after the adoption of the new Constitution. However, it seems it has deliberately refused to implement the devolution clauses in the Constitution for selfish reasons. Firstly, Zanu PF is now a rural party and elections since 2000 have proved that. And secondly, urban areas are the engine of economic growth and allowing them to be controlled by the opposition will expose them to being poor administrators. Zanu PF is politically lucky that the main opposition — successor to Tsvangirai-led MDC — is also anti-devolution and has incompetent councils that have become champions of corruption and mismanagement. No one is seriously considering implementing devolution in the letter and spirit of the Constitution, except maybe David Coltart the Bulawayo mayor. And it is no coincidence he was a senior member of the Ncube-led MDC. It is clear that no one has the appetite for devolution among those in the political ring, except a few voices from civil society which deal with constitutionalism. Then we turn to this week’s event that seems to be the final nail into the devolution question. Finance minister Mthuli Ncube played another trick on the citizens or he was merely being used by the Executive to deliver the bad news. After Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting the following statement was issued: “Cabinet considered and approved the draft Zimbabwe Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfers Administrative Manual as presented by the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, Honourable Professor Mthuli Ncube,” before adding: “The nation is informed that Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfers from central to lower tiers of government are provided for under Section 301 of the Constitution. These transfers are meant to support the devolution of powers and responsibilities, with not less than 5% of national revenues raised in any financial year being allocated to provinces and local authorities.” Did Ncube deliberately misquote the section? Section 301(1) reads: “An Act of Parliament must provide for the equitable allocation of capital grants between provincial and metropolitan councils and local authorities; and any other allocations to provinces and local authorities, and any conditions on which those allocations may be made.” For the avoidance of doubt, a manual is not an Act of Parliament as envisaged in the Constitution. So, a question arises: Why is Ncube reluctant to bring to Parliament a Bill to address the issue of Section 301? A short answer to the question is: Zanu PF is not genuine on devolution and has never been. It still wants the all-powerful central government to be the only player in national and developmental politics. This is not the first time Ncube has dribbled Parliament. In the Finance Act of 2018, Ncube pulled the same trick. He amended the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act to abolish the National Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Board that controlled the Indigenisation Fund. The Fund was transferred to the Finance ministry. Ncube is playing the prince in President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s Cabinet. He is untouchable and can even effect changes to Acts of Parliament that do not fall under his purview. In other words, he is a super-minister. The time is now to stop this nonsense. Either the Zanu PF regime enacts a law as required by the Constitution on devolution or they can resort to their default position and repeal the sections of the Constitution which deal with devolution. They cannot continue to pick and choose which laws to obey. The onus is now on all progressive MPs and civil society to demand the full implementation of the 2013 Constitution, particularly on devolution. Zanu PF cannot continue to decide which areas to develop at its whim and the expected political fortunes they can derive from the areas they develop. Local people should determine their development as the Constitution dictates. Someone has to put a stop to this. Probably, starting with the MPs squaring up to Ncube to explain this hogwash. Or someone has to take him to the court and have him compelled to bring the Devolution Bill to Parliament. Or better still Parliament refusing to pass a vote for devolution funds until a Bill is passed on the same. "

                     Do more to end stigmatising of mental illness
                    ","EVERY year, Mental Health Awareness Month [May] has various mainstream media (news, social and entertainment) platitudinously state or promote the obvious: That society, collectively and as individuals, must open up its/our minds and encourage common dialogue towards far more fruitfully treating and preventing mental illness. Needless to say, everyone will agree, at least publicly, that stigmatising such illness and, by extension, its bearers should have ceased long ago. But then that is basically as far as it goes. Unlike with the loud and apparently quite effective voices lobbying the news, social and entertainment media against reinforcing stereotypes based on skin colour, sexuality, gender and even gender bending; there is no comparable influential protest voice against reinforcing stereotypes based on mental illness. I believe it is called the squeaky-wheel effect. When it comes to irresponsibly stereotyping and/or stigmatising people specifically living with schizophrenia, the 2008 box-office-hit movie The Dark Knight (as overall entertaining as it was) could be a textbook example. In one shameful scene, the glorified Batman character recklessly erroneously grumbles to the district attorney character Harvey Dent that the sinisterly-sneering clearly-conscience-lacking murderer he has handcuffed to a wheeled stretcher is “a paranoid schizophrenic — exactly the kind of mind that the Joker attracts”. I should add here, however, that I rather enjoyed and appreciated the relatively sympathetic theme on poverty and especially mental illness in the 2019 film Joker. Like The Dark Knight, the 2021 horror-flick old also stigmatises schizophrenia via a creepy character’s violent behaviour. We had entered the third millennium, yet a 4/4-star-rated Hollywood hit movie as well as a much more recent film, could still be readily found flagrantly demonising characters based on their mental illness. There was no societal or vocal condemnation. It seemed to not matter that people living with schizophrenia are generally more likely to harm themselves and/or be a victim of violence than they are to harm others. - Frank Sterle Jr "

                     Devotion: The heart of prayer
                    ","THE Father is not trying to make you cry ceaselessly, but He wants your heart. There is a simple Biblical interpretation system you can apply that you do not necessarily have to know Hebrew and Greek to understand what the Bible is saying. Praying without ceasing cannot mean when you start praying and break for eating or meeting or whatever you do on this earth, when you pray later you are restarting and need to remind God that you have come back. You were together in the meeting or the dining table. He never ever leaves you even if you feel you are alone. We need to think. Let us look at the Scripture. 1 Thessalonians 5:17 reads: “Pray without ceasing.” The verse is not saying when you start praying, don’t stop until the return of Christ. The Father is looking for those devoted to prayer. He wants us to be loyal. It is not so much of how long, but how sincere. You can pray the whole day or for 30 minutes. What matters at the end is how intimate were you. Let me help those who fast and pray for say 40 or 21 days. On the last day they fail to break the fast at sunset and eat around lunch. Some think they missed it and then brush aside the “incomplete” prayer and fasting. They feel unworthy, inadequate and condemned. But if you were sincere, God the Father heard you. It is the devil who wants to accuse you that you did not run the full length. Begin to thank God and praise Him for answered prayer. After all fasting is for our discipline, not for God to move or intervene, He is there with you whether fasting or not. A believer cannot ask the Father to intervene. From where? The Godhead, i.e. God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are in you. Let us look at Luke 18:1: “And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint.” The simplest explanation here is that don’t give up on prayer. Don’t faint, pick yourself up. Maybe you pray and fast for so long and you don’t get the desired result, please don’t curve in, give up or surrender. Please remember that God always gives us what we need. We don’t faint, but keep praying. Our prayers are from the heart not that we saw someone with the latest car and we change prayer points. That is carnality. In case you missed some of our teachings, New Testament prayers are basically praise and thanksgiving for what the Father has already given us in Christ. If you fix your eyes on Jesus, you will be victorious and more than conquerors. You may know fellow believers who get into cooperate prayer and spend the better part of the night and morning dealing with “principalities”. Why not spend the whole night and morning speaking to God in praise, worship and thanksgiving and He tells you that the “principality” has been dealt a blow and will never come near you. We shall reconcile why someone prays 10 minutes and all demons start crying and leave. Someone sits on a mountain from Friday and comes to church on Sunday and no one gets healing or “feel” the anointing. We have all along measured prayer quantitatively and not qualitatively. God the Father says don’t be like hypocrites who love to be seen, but rather have an intimate relationship with Him. Commit to prayer, be loyal and be devoted. When we deal with praying in the spirit, we shall see how some can pray from bedtime till morning. Let me quote one verse and I am out; Proverbs 4:23: “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen. Grace and peace be multiplied to you through knowledge. "

                     The whimsical world of work-life balance
                    ","AH, work-life balance, that elusive unicorn we all chase in the modern-day savannah of our lives. It’s like trying to find a comfortable position on an economy flight—seemingly impossible, yet endlessly pursued. We are told to lean in, but not too far lest we fall over. We are encouraged to hustle, yet reminded to stop and smell the roses—which, by the way, are now available in a convenient aerosol can for those too busy to find an actual garden. Let’s ponder the term “work-life balance” for a moment. It implies a scale, perfectly poised with work on one side and life on the other. But who can maintain such a precarious position? One unexpected email, and suddenly you are doing acrobatics to keep from toppling over. It’s less of a balance and more of a juggling act, where the balls are made of responsibilities, hobbies, and the occasional Netflix binge. Consider the modern office, a place where “open plan” has come to mean “no escape”. Your boss can now see you from across the room, making those covert social media checks all the more thrilling. And let’s not forget the symphony of typing, phone calls and the guy who eats celery like it’s his job. It’s a wonder we get anything done amid the cacophony of productivity. But then there is life—the part of the equation that is supposed to be all about relaxation and joy. Except, life has its own set of demands. Gym memberships that mock us with their unused potential, social events that require the energy we left at the office, and hobbies that have started to feel suspiciously like second jobs. We are in a constant state of toggling between tasks, trying to squeeze in a semblance of leisure between the cracks of our calendars. And yet, despite the chaos, there is something beautiful about the hustle. It’s in the small victories, like leaving work on time or turning off your phone for an hour of peace. It’s in the moments of connection, when we actually look up from our screens and engage with the world around us. It is in the realisation that balance is not about perfection; it’s about finding harmony in the discord. So, as we navigate the tightrope of our daily routines, let’s embrace the imbalance. Let’s celebrate the small wins and laugh at the absurdity of it all. Because at the end of the day, work-life balance is not a destination; it’s a journey—one that is best travelled with a sense of humour and the occasional detour into the ridiculous. And who knows? Maybe along the way, we will find that the unicorn is not so mythical after all. - Kumbirai Thierry Nhamo "

                     Youths should be on the forefront of climate change
                    ","THIS article was written out of the pain we went through as young people in rural Binga. I still remember we would travel 10 kilometres to fetch water from a river, in a village called Tinde. This happened at the expense of other things such as our education. When it rained ferociously we were at times not able to cross the river from school. We would wait until the water subsided and travelled home at night. This did not look problematic then. It was a normal life. The worst part was to discover late in life that all those things were slowly impacting other things such as our education and the quality of life in general. In the end it affected our results. Our life was affected by climate. We cannot avoid climate, it has cataclysmic impacts on our lives. In the face of a rapidly changing climate, the world stands at a pivotal juncture and leaders must take a firm stand. The decisions we make today will shape the planet for generations to come and our legislative house should have young people who are ready to lobby and advocate for laws on climate change. Among the most powerful agents of change in this global endeavour are the youths. We cannot stand and wait for other people to do it for us. Youths are not just the leaders of tomorrow, but also the catalysts of impactful change today. Understanding climate change It is up to the youths to investigate what climate change is so as to make relevant decisions. Generally, climate change refers to momentous changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over a period of time. While climate has changed throughout the Earth’s history, human activities have been driving unprecedented changes over the last century. These include the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial processes, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide into the earth’s atmosphere. Role of youths Young leaders possess the numbers, energy and creativity necessary for a sustainable future. First, education is important. Knowledge is power. By becoming well-informed about the science of climate change and its consequences, leaders can spread awareness and inspire action within their communities. Learning is important when change is happening. We cannot oppose the change that climate has brought. Opposing is just futile. So information on climate change is important. When we have the requisite education it becomes easy to innovate. Youths can use the leverage of technology to develop innovative solutions to reduce carbon footprints, such as applications that track energy consumption or platforms that facilitate the sharing of resources. However, in rural Binga we had no computers. To make matters worse we did not even know how a computer looked like. As we speak now, we have children who have never seen a computer, let alone touch it. Now we need to accelerate how rural children and leaders have access to these technologies. Young leaders have energy for activism: Young activists can mobilise the masses through campaigns, protests and social media, putting pressure on policymakers to enact environmentally friendly policies. Besides, we need Parliament to be flooded by young leaders who will speak and debate about climate change. We need to learn sustainable practices. Now there is talk of not only smart cities, but green cities. We must adopt sustainable lifestyles, such as reducing waste, conserving water and choosing renewable energy sources to significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. Politics shapes a lot of things. Without political will, we cannot win. In our next elections, the electorate must make sure we vote for people who are committed to climate change. By voting for leaders committed to fighting climate change and even running for office, young people can influence political agendas and steer legislative action towards sustainable development.. Parting point The battle against climate change is daunting, but it is not insurmountable. With youths at the helm, there is hope for a greener, cleaner and more sustainable future. Their actions today will echo through the ages, and it is imperative that they are equipped, encouraged and empowered to lead the way in this existential fight. This is a call to action for young individuals and leaders in Zimbabwe and the world in general to rise up and take ownership of the climate crisis. Their passion, combined with concerted efforts, can turn the tide against climate change and pave the way for a healthier planet. "

                     PVO Bill poisoned chalice.
                    ","The upcoming Public Hearings for the PVO Bill next week show that the government is determined to shut down civic space.  There is concern that if 10,000 organizations were to express interest in registering to support persons with disabilities, they may be restricted based solely on the fact that they have the same mandate.  This limitation goes against the fundamental principles of freedom of association and expression, which are essential for a thriving civil society. The PVO Bill aims to amend the Private Voluntary Organizations Act, which was first enacted in 1990 to regulate and monitor the operations of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Zimbabwe.  However, many civil society organizations (CSOs) have raised concerns about the proposed amendments, stating that they will severely restrict their ability to operate and fulfill their mandates. One of the main issues with the PVO Bill is the provision that limits the number of organizations that can register to support a particular cause.  This not only goes against the principles of inclusivity and diversity, but it also undermines the potential impact of collective action. If thousands of organizations are willing to work together towards a common goal, they should not be restricted based on their numbers. Furthermore, the Bill also dictates the structure and composition of PVOs, which should be determined by the organizations themselves. While some CSOs have a membership-based structure, others have a combination of trustees and members, and some operate solely through trustees.  These are all acceptable forms, as long as there are proper checks and balances in place to ensure good governance and accountability. By imposing a specific structure, the government is overstepping its boundaries and impeding on the autonomy of CSOs. However, the most alarming aspect of the PVO Bill is the provision that allows for the politicization of aid and funding for political parties. This not only goes against the role of CSOs as independent entities, but it also raises concerns about the potential misuse of funds and the alignment of aid with political agendas.  Many CSOs have voiced their opposition to this provision, stating that it could compromise their credibility and hinder their ability to effectively serve the communities they are meant to support. In addition to these concerns, there are also provisions in the Bill that could lead to the prosecution of individuals within PVOs for misnomers of their organizations.  This creates a culture of fear and could be used as a tool to target individuals who are working towards social and political change. It is important to note that organizations are legal persons and should be held accountable as such, rather than targeting individuals who may be acting on behalf of the organization. CSOs have consolidated their concerns and recommendations in their submissions to parliament, but it is worrying that the Bill is being fast-tracked without proper consideration for these concerns.  The media reports that the Bill will be passed as is, despite the numerous objections and recommendations from CSOs and other stakeholders. President Mnangagwa had initially intervened in the drafting of the PVO Bill, providing an opportunity for the government to reconsider some of the provisions. However, his concerns were not addressed, and the Bill remains unchanged.  This goes against the government's commitment to creating an enabling environment for civil society to thrive and fulfill their roles in society. If passed, the PVO Bill will not only restrict the operations of CSOs, but it will also have a chilling effect on civic space in Zimbabwe. It will limit the ability of organizations to advocate for the rights and needs of their constituents, and ultimately hinder the development and progress of the country. It is imperative that individuals and organizations come out in large numbers to the Public Hearings for the PVO Bill and voice their opposition to the proposed amendments.  This is a crucial opportunity for citizens to exercise their right to participate in the legislative process and make their voices heard. The more people who show up and speak out against the Bill, the stronger the message will be to the government that the proposed amendments are not acceptable. Additionally, it is important for citizens to understand the potential impact of the PVO Bill and how it could restrict the operations of civil society organizations and limit their ability to serve the communities they work in.  By attending the Public Hearings and rejecting the Bill, individuals will be standing up for the rights and needs of all Zimbabweans and promoting a more inclusive and democratic society. Let us come together and make our voices heard to protect the future of civic space in our country. "

                     ED must innovate to create a new economy
                    ","THE economic chaos and structural deformities are a boon to the creation of an alternative industry and commerce. New business has germinated, creating millions of jobs. The chaos has created immense opportunities that are being exploited to the full. Better than formal jobs in many instances. In this suffering some want the status quo to remain and they are in their millions. Attempting to formalise the economy and correct deformities will cause massive bleeding of these underground and alternative jobs. It requires strategic innovation to create more and better jobs in a formal economy. This is the challenge the government faces and seems blind on how to navigate it. The government is driven to formalise. Unfortunately, what in the so-called formal economy, job creation is a mirage and is not a desired strategic outcome for companies. Companies actually desire to destroy jobs rather than creating them. Automation, modernisation, artificial intelligence, robotics and other technologies are all driven at industry with hope of substituting the unionised labour force. It creates few other jobs, but in Zimbabwe we have a more serious and significant challenge. Our challenge is that our emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics higher education is very pale after its local architect, former minister Jonathan Moyo was discarded into the political dustbin, literally throwing away the bath water together with the baby. We have hordes of universities with more than 60% studying social sciences, arts and commercials. This will never create a new economy, the one that can deliver new jobs. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has to think smart on how to create a new economy to absorb the informal industries created by government’s absolute and disastrous failures. Millions are now employed in the parallel economy. Examples I give below are “industries” that will go extinct in a formal and working economy. The examples above are critical because the government has multiple challenges to innovate around job creation, diversifying the economy, reskilling, attracting new talent, diaspora migration, skills partnerships and re-education. The task this present government face is one that requires strategic innovation beyond extractive and primary industries of mining and agriculture. At present the government does not show passion at investing in that arena and have skills to drive a new country trajectory. It has to start with the mind. Yet here we are as a country still innovating around the familiar of agriculture and mining. The dilemma is keeping the current trajectory of an informal economy which is underground, whose income is undeclared and businesses are unregistered. We will continue to witness house construction, cars sales, private schools, bars, foreign trips and luxury purchases with no real income being realised by, for instance, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, National Social Security Authority, Zimbabwe Development Fund and municipalities. Public goods will be demanded from persons without a taxpayer number. The cities and towns will be burdened with residents who want the best but paying nothing for it. It does not seem we have the mind to innovate outside the familiar to destroy the prevailing economic chaos. We do not seem to have the skills, structures, systems and strategy to do so at Cabinet level. The alternative is equally problematic in that a formal economy which does not create jobs will pose existential threats to the ruling party. It can cause chaos. Idle minds will create a headache to the ruling class. Our government, Cabinet and ministries are still the same as in 1965 and for them to leapfrog in innovation to create formal jobs requires a new mindset. Most ministries are no longer fit for purpose. Then the question is who exactly in government is responsible for creating the new economy? Who co-ordinates several value creating ministries to ensure they get out of incremental innovation mode to disruptive and radical innovation? If, as a country, we have no clear answer and we are not creating jobs as a government, then we have failed. If we don’t have an environment to enable private enterprise to create jobs, then we have absolutely failed. If we destroy the old jobs without creating new jobs, then we are creating fertile ground for discontent to manifest. The big question is what is the government going to do with millions who are now self-employed due to government ineptitude? And, how will these people react if and when their “jobs” are taken away? The President must innovate outside the familiar to create a new formal economy with new jobs.   "

                     Africa’s role in delivering a new health win
                    ","DISEASES like smallpox used to be inevitable. However, thanks to the life-saving power of vaccines and global collaboration, decades have passed since the last case. Health workers, community members and global leaders came together to permanently eradicate smallpox. Shortly after this historic feat, the world turned its attention to eradicating polio, another debilitating, preventable disease that attacks the nervous system and can cause lifelong paralysis or even death. Thanks to vaccines, health workers’ dedication and decades of global collaboration, wild polio cases have fallen by 99,9%, and 20 million people are walking today who would have otherwise been paralysed by the virus. Immunisation is one of our most successful and cost-effective public health interventions. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation, the routine vaccine schedule developed by the World Health Organisation in 1974, which is responsible for protecting many from the most common childhood viruses, including polio. New data released in The Lancet reveals that global immunisation efforts have saved an estimated 154 million lives over the past 50 years and have contributed to reducing infant deaths by more than 50% across Africa. However, making history is never easy. Despite decades of dedication and leadership from African Health ministers and other government leaders, challenges in reaching all children with polio vaccines remain. COVID-19-related disruptions to vaccine delivery fuelled the largest backslide in immunisation in three decades as health systems were overwhelmed and resources were diverted, leaving the most vulnerable without protection. The consequences of this backslide were severe. In 2022, Malawi, followed by Mozambique, reported the first cases of wild poliovirus in Africa in over five years, imported from abroad. Due to the drops in immunisation coverage, 15 countries — including Zimbabwe — in the region have been fighting to stop ongoing variant polio outbreaks since 2021. Strong routine immunisation coverage is critical to stopping polio. In eastern and southern Africa, 4,6 million children missed out on routine immunisation during the pandemic. For example, more than 977 000 children in Madagascar and 1,3 million children in Somalia did not receive a single vaccine dose between 2020 and 2022. Eradicating polio requires at least 95% vaccine coverage to stop the virus circulation and strong routine immunisation to prevent new infections. Despite efforts to boost immunisation rates, the same children continue to be missed. These “zero-dose” children, who have never been reached with any vaccines, often live in the hardest-to-reach areas, leaving them at risk of illness or even death from preventable diseases such as measles and polio. We have just returned from Madagascar, where there are more than one million “zero-dose” children between two and five years old. Data from the Public Health ministry shows that in 22 out of 23 regions of the country, less than 50% of children received their first dose of the polio vaccine at birth. We were heartened to hear from leaders and healthcare workers about how they are working to protect more children from infectious diseases. Under the guidance of the government, we can support their efforts to prioritise routine immunisation within the country’s primary healthcare system and urgently scale up efforts to close these extremely worrying immunity gaps. Much work remains to strengthen health systems in Madagascar and across the region so that we can protect every child against vaccine-preventable diseases. The needs are complex and daunting — but key to overcoming each and every challenge needs one single necessity: Political will. We are regularly reminded that “vaccines don’t save lives; vaccination saves lives”. For vaccination to happen, it is vital that leaders across the continent stay committed to investing in their health systems and vaccines, and publicly demonstrate their support for polio vaccination and wider immunisation. Continued engagement with community health workers and community leaders is also critical to achieving high rates of immunisation, even among the most vulnerable children. In October 2023, Zimbabwean health authorities declared officially the circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak a public health emergency following detection of the disease in environmental samples collected in Harare. The Health and Child Care ministry is co-ordinating the implementation of polio outbreak response activities including a nationwide polio vaccination campaign. The country has conducted two rounds of nationwide polio vaccination campaigns in February and March 2024, reaching more than 4,8 million children. Zimbabwe, like many other countries, remains at risk of polio outbreaks until the disease is completely eradicated from the world. It is, therefore, important that the population immunity against polio is maintained high. Efforts to increase routine polio vaccination coverage and strengthened disease surveillance for early detection of cases remain top priority. The world has a historic opportunity to end polio for good, but if we do not remain committed, the virus could quickly make a comeback and paralyse thousands of children again every year. Eradication may feel close within reach, but we — governments, partners, donors — must fully and urgently step up and support to cross the finish line. We did it for smallpox, and we can do it again — it is humanly possible.  Etleva Kadilli, Unicef regional director, eastern and southern Africa and Christopher J Elias, is president of global development at Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.    "

It is the things we work passionately on for the benefit of others that cause positive ripples and profit us. Each of us have power to change this country by searching for our why and pursuing it passionately. Harriet Tubman emphasised the importance of understanding our past in shaping the future, stating: “We are not informed by where we are; we are informed by where we have been.” Where Zimbabwe has been says that while politics destroyed this country, with our participation by commission or omission, it is leadership and enterprise at an individual level that will build something greater on these ruins. The emergence of our better angels will eventually shape the political landscape and not vice versa. No magic wand, no quick fix, let alone an individual will transform Zimbabwe. Nation building is heavy lifting, multifaceted, time consuming and needs all hands on deck. To aid our individual endeavours are 10 overarching factors with tremendous potential to transform Zimbabwe, namely: The direct link between rule of law and development is well-studied and has long been established. Our problems are far bigger than Zanu PF and the opposition or the real and perceived differences between President Emmerson Mnangangwa and Nelson Chamisa. A solution to our dysfunction will emerge when there is scale in the number of people who bet for the country rather than self or sectional interests. Noble causes take time to become mainstream, but when they do they create a groundswell which hatches its own leaders. "

                     Let’s build a strong AI adoption framework
                    ","RESEARCHERS argue that people's perceptions of reality shape their adoption of technology. The excitement and confusion surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) highlight the importance of underlying assumptions, meanings and expectations about the adoption of this important technology. These interpretations significantly impact AI adoption, making a clear framework crucial for any organisation or country navigating this process. Do you think Zimbabwe is adopting AI well? The answer hinges on whether you know the framework that the country is using to guide its AI journey. What is a framework? In the context of technology adoption, a framework is a structured approach that guides the introduction of a new technology. It acts as a plan, outlining the essential steps, considerations and best practices to ensure successful integration. Think about building a house. You would not just randomly put up walls and a roof. A blueprint, which acts as a framework, describes the different stages of construction, the materials needed and the order in which things should be built. Similarly, a technology adoption framework provides a roadmap for the effective use of the new technology. AI is a hot topic, and many countries are scrambling to adopt it and Zimbabwe has also made some inroads. As a country we have shifted from questioning “should we adopt AI?” to “are we adopting AI the right way?” This series delves into this crucial question and as a Member of Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on ICT, I have observed numerous efforts by both the public and private sectors to create and adopt AI solutions. The troubling aspect is that these efforts lack a guiding framework or a dedicated AI plan. As explained earlier, the absence of a framework hinders strategic AI adoption. This has hampered many African countries in the past when adopting technologies. We often rely on foreign frameworks, leading to limited benefits from these technologies. China's New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP), announced in 2017, serves as a powerful case study for the importance of a national AI plan.  This ambitious plan outlined China's goal to become the global leader in AI by 2030, create a trillion-yuan AI industry, and shape ethical norms for AI development. The AIDP provided a long-term vision, fostering domestic AI research, talent development and public-private collaboration. Looking back, it is undeniable that this strategic approach has positioned China as a leading force in AI. Global race for AI supremacy AI has emerged as a new battleground for international competition, with nations recognising its potential to drive economic prosperity and national security. Developed countries are prioritising AI development to boost competitiveness, accelerate their economic growth and national security. Many developing countries have also joined the race and are intensifying their implementation plans and strategies for this core technology. Key areas of focus for developing countries include infrastructural development, research and development, talent development and establishing regulatory frameworks. Zimbabwe's call to action Looking at the global landscape, it is clear that Zimbabwe needs to elevate AI development to a national strategic level. To compete and thrive in the future, a comprehensive framework for AI adoption is critical. Pillars of a successful AI framework As mentioned earlier, a successful AI adoption framework should possess the following characteristics: Provide structure: Break down the AI adoption process into smaller, manageable steps, making it less daunting and more achievable. Identify key considerations: Focus on crucial considerations throughout the process, such as infrastructure requirements, human resource needs and potential risks. Integrate best practices: Incorporate existing global best practices and lessons learned from previous technology implementations. Adaptable: Be flexible enough to be tailored to Zimbabwe's specific needs and context. Charting the course This series will delve into a comprehensive framework for advancing AI in Zimbabwe. We wll define key steps across various domains to ensure the effective integration and responsible deployment of AI technologies. Our goal is to equip key stakeholders with valuable insights into Zimbabwe's AI readiness and potential hurdles. This will lay the foundation for informed decision-making and strategic planning concerning AI development in Zimbabwe. "

                     ZiG is yet another infernal nuisance
                    ","GOOD day, President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Your Excellency, my conscience affirms that the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) is yet another infernal nuisance. As I see it, it is deficient, devoid of the core fundamentals of a propitious currency. Truly, ZiG is not an economic eureka. It is burdened by a credibility crisis. Like the buffalo soldier Bob Marley sang about, who fought for survival on arrival, ZiG was never destined to have it easy. Henceforth its introduction was shrouded in mistrust due to Zimbabwe being a commonly loathed black sheep regionally and far beyond. Hence, your 2018 application to rejoin the Commonwealth is still pending. Your Excellency, Zimbabwe has accumulated massive negative returns because of its propensity to hold harmonised elections that fail the credibility test. Notwithstanding the punitive sanctions that were recently imposed on you by the United States government, indeed, your government has an onerous credibility deficit. There is a cost to a government in the hands of a ruling elite of low reputation. It cannot evade censure for attaining power illegitimately and for not being respectful of human rights. The fact that ZiG is backed by gold and other precious minerals, however, does not suffice to build confidence. It failed to set forth sighs of relief that are ordinarily expected as a welcome to a currency that is billed as being backed by gold and other precious minerals. It is a verity that Zimbabwe is bequeathed with an abundance of minerals, ranging from gold, diamonds to many others. It actually takes a geologist, of which I am not one, to roll call the deposits of mineral treasures which, all things being equal, could sufficiently back the ZiG. Yet, besides the abundance, citizenry is not convinced that the said reserves of natural resources are available in requisite quantities to back ZiG. Given that there were grey areas with regards to the quantities of gold that were in the vaults at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), during your recent inspection visit, a dearth of trust was pronounced. Consequently, ZiG is yet another infernal nuisance. It is apparent that citizenry regards the notion of ZiG being backed by gold and other precious minerals with not only suspicion, but also askance and disdain. Your Excellency, citizenry remembers well the gold corruption exposé investigative documentary, Gold Mafia. It was an antithesis of accountability and transparency that government retaliated by unleashing tirades on the news channel that compiled the document. And, government went on to renege on its promise to investigate the corruption allegations that were raised in the documentary. Prior to that, the late former President Robert Mugabe alleged that US$15 billion worth of diamonds had fallen into corrupt hands in Chiyadzwa. Yet again, no investigations were carried out. With ZiG coming as it does on the backdrop of apprehensions due to previous collapsed currencies and corruption, it is inevitably struggling for acceptance. Indeed, citizenry is sceptical about ZiG, through and through. Your Excellency, Zimbabwe has an unsavoury reputation for introducing new currencies now and then. Since independence, failed currencies have been your government’s Achilles heel. All successive currencies failed to hold their own. Now, as ZiG replaces the Zimdollar that progressively lost value henceforth your reintroducing it in 2019, from where I stand, ZiG is not an economic eureka. I reckon the vendor who said she would rather lose a sale than accept ZiG stated with exactitude the magnitude of the disapproval rating of the new currency. Its a yawning deficit of confidence and credibility which is commensurate with the reputation of your government. Verily, the introduction of ZiG ought to have set alight a flaming euphoria that could have generated anticipation and acceptance of the currency if the fundamentals were correct. Yet, that has not been the case as the ZiG’s launch was as a dull as the recitation of platitudes. Your Excellency, ZiG is shrouded in a plethora of credibility and legitimacy crisis. Methinks citizenry is of the conviction that ZiG is by no means the long anticipated economic eureka. Given the magnitude of mistrust in government, duly, ZiG inevitably suffers a likewise fate. It, therefore, needed skilful communicators to execute its launch. Yet, with all due respect, it is the irony of a national launch of the new currency that the crew that is spearheading the ZiG introduction does not exhibit a thing or two about public relations. They have hardly shown themselves as congenial and credible. With all due respect, they are not given to persuasion. It is small wonder that their wooden approach can be attributed to ZiG being overtly regarded as yet another infernal nuisance. There is a gulf of credibility deficit that yearns to be bridged. Consequently, the engagement of articulate communicators ought not have been foregone. As I see it, the failure of ZiG to excite citizenry could have been minimised had the launch been planned diligently. It is my studied evaluation that the RBZ governor John Mushayavanhu ought to gather and bundle himself neatly. He has to add communication mastery to his remarkable professional faculties. Otherwise, the inevitable history of failed currencies will be perpetuated under his watch. His contradictory statements are detrimental to building of confidence and acceptance of ZiG. Considering that he sits at the pole of the apex bank, truly, probity warrants him to invest in acquiring communication proficiencies. He must be an accomplished communicator whose concise statements are ethical and renowned for clarity of thought and credibility. It is of paramount importance that he be admirably conclusive, coherent and convincing in his communication. His backtracking on the conceptualisation of ZiG after the World Bank clarification of the bounds of its consultancy role, is detrimental to his reputation as the incumbent RBZ governor. Your Excellency, be that as it may, forsooth, ZiG is yet another infernal nuisance. "

                     Benefits of integrating food systems with education
                    ","AFRICAN agriculture cannot be transformed in isolation because in most agriculture-driven economies agriculture anchors more than 75% of other sectors. The fact that agriculture and food systems transformation require some technical knowledge from technocrats along value chains is a major reason for tying food systems to the education sector. Technocrats like agronomists, agriculture economists and livestock specialists often come from tertiary institutions whose knowledge can only be valuable if curricula are frequently reviewed. Power of specialisation Broader agriculture and food system transformation is about specialisation through which value chains can be fully exploited instead of exporting raw commodities which happens due to lack of rigorous specialisation. For instance, one of the reasons most African countries continue to export fruits in a raw state is because these countries have not invested in knowledge in fruit processing and value addition through formal education systems including tertiary institutions. Countries importing raw fruits from Africa have kept specialised knowledge to themselves as part of protecting their advantages which they do not want to lose by sharing highly specialised knowledge. After farmers have done their part by producing all kinds of commodities, the onus is on African academics and researchers to become specialists in ensuring African food commodities are not exported in a raw state. That is why education curricula should produce specialists for every commodity at every level. Each African country should have more food scientists than political scientists and each commodity should have a big team of food scientists from farm to fork. Given that more than 70% of agricultural production is in the hands of women, gender and women’s empowerment in agriculture should be an integral component of university curricula at the same level as production, logistics and food processing. More value can also be generated when institutions of higher learning like polytechnics and universities are twinned with communities. It is unfortunate that institutions of higher learning are missing in the production of appropriate technology which has become a domain for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in infrastructure and equipment enterprises. Given that the majority of youth who fail to succeed academically end up in agricultural production and marketing, creates opportunities for peer-to-peer knowledge transfer in line with key characteristics like age and gender. It is easier for youths to convince each other as they are good at communicating through tools like ICTs. However, ICTs should not be used as an avenue for taxing ordinary people for the benefit of a few. For instance, African banks, mobile service providers and insurance companies are using ICTs to siphon money from people who have become addicted to social media. What is the source of information for transforming agriculture and food systems? If education curricula are silent on information sources it is difficult to achieve transformation. This is because, due to a competitive mindset, private companies share knowledge selectively. In most cases private companies promote their good side through ignoring lessons and challenges which may actually be more important. One the other hand, public sources of information like mass markets can provide valuable information because they have much exposure to many actors and impacts. Academic institutions can use the food system to generate evidence with great potential for influencing policy attention towards the recognition, support and protection of mass markets, SMEs and availing of appropriate technologies on processing and preservation. When support becomes part of national programmes driven by colleges and universities, the fiscus can see value in supporting academic departments that are developing home-grown agricultural supply chains and food systems. Knowledge around appropriate food preservation technologies can be embedded at industrial parks occupied by the young generation who are attached to colleges and universities. This is how colleges and universities can unlock more value from key economic drivers in production zones where more than 30% of horticultural produce is lost due to lack of appropriate food preservation technologies. Consolidating all these outcomes will enable policies to support the creation of industries that are embedded with knowledge and skills from colleges and universities which can assist in creating employment for graduates from institutions of higher learning. As long as higher learning institutions are not generating knowledge and skills that can grow agriculture and food systems into a viable industrial ecosystem, graduate unemployment will continue rising since there will be no industry to absorb all graduates churned out by tertiary institutions every year. SMEs are currently dominated by people whose knowledge levels may not be able to employ sophisticated graduates. It means graduates from colleges and universities have to develop frameworks for creating their own employment. Government is doing its part by providing an enabling environment for academic institutions to apply their knowledge and lure private investors who can build frameworks for employing graduates. Much can be achieved by streamlining academic programmes from the current more than 100 subjects being studied in one university department. For the sake of uniformity and consistency in consolidating and rolling out relevant knowledge, the subjects should not be more than 20 in one department because the more the subjects the shallower the knowledge outcomes. A consolidated framework will also assist in positioning supply chain actors and supporting institutions that are currently working in silos instead of collaborating through synchronised knowledge, expertise and skills towards recognising, supporting and protecting the agricultural sector and food systems. Absence of positioning and consolidation is one of the major reasons why there is a mismatch between knowledge and information about the needs of each supply chain node. When more than 90% of the knowledge acquired at higher level is underutilised in communities, it translates to low return on investment. Critical questions include: Who is driving African agriculture and food systems and what level of expertise do those people have/need? What skills base is driving the agricultural sector and entire food systems? Colleges and universities should be positioned at a level where they can answer some of these questions in building higher level expertise models that can then be unpacked for lower-level institutions. Consolidation is also required at the level of government departments so that the Agriculture ministry does not continue to run with its own extension officers without any relationship with other government departments like industry, health, ICTs, local government and commerce or SMEs. Consolidating initiatives made by several institutions of higher learning and other stakeholders can also enhance resource utilisation and re-purposing in ways that generate more value. When data, information and knowledge are consolidated, it becomes possible to approach mass markets as institutions not a collection of individual farmers, vendors and traders. Production zones will also be considered institutions that should have a strong relationship with formal institutions for purposes of knowledge co-creation, adding value to resources on the production side as well as making visible the contribution of SMEs and mass markets to socio-economic development. Currently, there is no such consolidated platform in most African countries, making it difficult to see synergies between existing supply chain technologies such as ICTs, production technologies like irrigation systems, preservation technologies, food processing technologies and many others. Gaps can only be seen and closed through consolidation which can also assist in answering questions like: Due to the prevailing mentality which does not recognise rural communities, production zones, mass markets and SMEs as institutions with valuable knowledge and skills that can guide industrial development, most African universities are not approaching mass markets and similar institutions for student attachments. Yet, at a time African countries are grappling with global knowledge and home-grown indigenous growth pathways for transitioning from colonial systems, it is not enough to depend on formal academic education and formal companies. No wonder structural unemployment is increasing in most African countries as shown by how most academic qualifications do not match industry requirements. To what extent can the so-called informal sector continue to be called informal when it is the one providing wage employment as shown in African mass food markets. "

                     Gummies vs. flower vs. concentrates: The difference between THCA products
                    ","The cannabis industry has seen a remarkable evolution in recent years, with a wide array of products entering the market, catering to a diverse set of preferences and needs. Among these, THCA products stand out for their unique properties.  THCA is a non-psychoactive precursor to THC, the compound primarily responsible for the euphoric effects associated with cannabis. THCA products come in various forms, including flowers, vapes, concentrates, and gummies, each offering different experiences. Let’s explore the distinct characteristics of these products, providing insights into their effects, benefits, and suitability for different types of users. THCA is found in the trichomes of fresh and undried cannabis plants. Its transformation into THC, the psychoactive counterpart, occurs through a process called decarboxylation, which is induced by heat. Research has highlighted the potential of raw THCA in various therapeutic areas. It exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, and its neuroprotective effects are being studied for potential roles in treating neurodegenerative diseases.  Furthermore, THCA has shown promise in reducing nausea, making it a compound of interest for medical cannabis research. Despite its benefits, the non-psychoactive nature of THCA means that it does not interact with the body's endocannabinoid system in the same way as THC.  This distinction is crucial for users seeking the therapeutic benefits of cannabis without the psychoactivity.  However, for those interested in the traditional effects of cannabis, the conversion of THCA to THC through decarboxylation is a key process, allowing users to experience the mood-altering effects of THC. When THCA is heated, be it via lighter, vape coil, or something else, it turns into THC, and once that happens, your THCA vape, flower, or concentrate will give you the same exact benefits as THC (because that’s what it turns into)! These include: The THCA flower consists of the dried buds that contain THCA alongside other cannabinoids and terpenes.  The process of smoking or vaporizing the flower applies heat, triggering decarboxylation and converting THCA into THC. This traditional method of consumption allows for the immediate onset of effects, as the cannabinoids are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream. The experience of using THCA flower is influenced by several factors, including the strain, the environment, and the individual's biological makeup.  Some strains are bred for higher THCA content, leading to stronger effects upon decarboxylation. Smokers of THCA flower appreciate the natural aspect of the product and the ability to control the dosage through the amount consumed and the rate of inhalation. THCA concentrates represent a more refined and potent form of cannabis. These products are created through extraction processes that isolate cannabinoids, including THCA, from the plant material.  The result is a product with a much higher concentration of THCA, which, when decarboxylated, produces a powerful THC effect. Concentrates like live resin and rosin are particularly popular for their high purity and potency. These products are often consumed using methods like dabbing, which involves vaporizing the concentrate on a hot surface and inhaling the vapors.  The high concentration of THCA in these products means that even a small amount can produce strong effects, making concentrates a favorite among experienced cannabis users. The appeal of THCA concentrates lies not only in their potency but also in their ability to preserve the terpene profile of the cannabis plant, enhancing the flavor and aroma of the product.  However, the powerful effects of concentrates may be overwhelming for beginners or those with lower tolerances, making it important for users to start with small doses and gradually increase as needed. THCA vapes are a modern and convenient method of consuming cannabis, appealing to users who seek the benefits of THCA without the harshness of smoke.  Vaping devices heat the cannabis product to a temperature that activates the THCA, transforming most of it into THC, depending on the specific temperature used.  This method allows for precise control over the decarboxylation process, enabling users to tailor their experience based on their preference for THCA or THC effects. The technology behind THCA vapes focuses on delivering a clean, controlled dose of cannabinoids through inhalation, with less risk of combustion and the harmful byproducts associated with smoking.  These devices range from disposable pens to more sophisticated, rechargeable systems that can adjust temperature settings for optimal vaporization of THCA. THCA vape products often come in a variety of strains and flavors, incorporating terpenes and other cannabinoids to enhance the user experience.  This diversity allows consumers to choose products that meet their specific needs, whether they are looking for therapeutic effects, flavor profiles, or a combination of both. THCA gummies offer a discreet and convenient way to consume cannabis without the need for inhalation or the risks associated with smoking.  Unlike flowers and concentrates, the manufacturing process for gummies typically does not involve high levels of heat, meaning the THCA remains in its original form and does not convert to THC.  This makes THCA gummies an attractive option for those seeking the therapeutic benefits of cannabis without the psychoactive effects. The gummies are designed for oral consumption, with the cannabinoids being absorbed through the digestive system.  This method of consumption results in a slower onset of effects compared to inhalation, with the full impact often taking up to an hour or more to manifest. The dosage in gummies is carefully controlled, allowing users to easily manage their intake and avoid the risk of overconsumption. Choosing between THCA flowers, concentrates, and gummies depends on several factors, including the desired effects, the user's experience level, and personal preferences regarding consumption methods.  For those seeking immediate psychoactive effects, THCA flower and vapes offer the advantage of rapid decarboxylation through heat. People wanting immediate and intense effects should opt for concentrates. On the other hand, THCA gummies provide a non-psychoactive option for those interested in the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis without the high. The choice between THCA flower, vapes, concentrates, and gummies is highly personal and depends on the desired effects, individual preferences, and consumption method comfort levels.  Those seeking immediate and potent effects might lean towards concentrates, while users looking for a traditional and communal experience may prefer flower. For those interested in health benefits without intoxication, gummies offer an appealing alternative. When choosing a THCA product, it's essential to consider factors such as potency, onset time, duration of effects, and personal health considerations.  Smoking or vaping provides rapid effects but involves inhalation, which may not be suitable for everyone.  Concentrates offer high potency, which requires cautious dosing, especially for beginners.  Edibles offer a smoke-free alternative with longer-lasting effects, though the onset is slower, and dosing can be less precise. Product Type Consumption Method Decarboxylation Psychoactive Effects THCA Flower Smoking Yes Yes THCA Concentrates Dabbing Yes Yes THCA Vapes Vaporizing Yes Yes THCA Gummies Oral No No As the cannabis industry continues to evolve, so too does the range of THCA products available to consumers. From artisanal concentrates to gourmet edibles, the market is rich with options catering to every preference and need.  By understanding the distinct characteristics and effects of THCA flowers, concentrates, and gummies, consumers can make informed choices about their cannabis consumption, tailoring their experience to their desired outcomes. The choice between THCA gummies, flower, and concentrates ultimately comes down to personal preference and the specific effects each individual is seeking.  Whether looking for a potent psychoactive experience, a gentle introduction to cannabis, or the therapeutic benefits without the high, there is a THCA product suited to every need!

                     Effective communication: An invaluable problem solving tool
                    ","THE late American radio speaker and author Earl Nightingale once said that “successful people are not people without problems”. They are simply people who have learned to solve their problems, he said. Good communication skills are the bridge between confusion and clarity. They are the road to personal and career success. In this article, we will discuss what it means to be a good communicator and how one can grow their communication skills. Good communication is nothing more than effective communication of our thoughts and ideas. The degree of our success is determined by the extent to which we can communicate our needs. Effective communication is not just about being able to talk, but also about being able to express your thoughts and ideas with clarity and charisma. It is a skill that can be honed through regular practice and improvement. When communication is clear and concise, it leads to better understanding and reduces the likelihood of conflicts. Here are some habits to cultivate in order to become an effective communicator. Be articulate  The majority of people fall victim to using filler words like “umm,” “like”, “you know”, which can be seen as a lack of confidence in what one is saying. Consider the ease with which your bones glide in their sockets, exhibiting a fluid articulation. Likewise, it is advantageous for our communication to emulate this. When one speaks articulately, their concepts are conveyed more effectively. Pause before you respond Oftentimes when faced with a question the immediate reflex is to respond. When we are quick to respond we may not give our mind enough time to formulate a thoughtful response. Rushing to answer could result in using filler words or stumbling over our words. Therefore, it is wise to take a brief pause to gather your thoughts before communicating your response. Ask questions “The ability to ask questions is the greatest resource to learning the truth,” said Carl Gustav Jung, the late Swiss psychiatrist. We cheat ourselves of learning opportunities whenever we shy away from asking questions. Both intelligent and seemingly stupid questions are worth asking. Curiosity is the ladder to knowledge, and thus it is better to know the answer to a seemingly simple question. Write Writing is one of the best and oftentimes underappreciated tool that can sharpen our communication skills. Spend time writing out your thoughts and ideas. When we write we refine our ideas. Actively listen Instead of listening to respond, we should listen to understand. When we understand what is being communicated, it is easier to avoid conflict caused by misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Identify your objectives and be concise When our objectives are clear, it is more likely that we will get a satisfactory response. When we are concise, we are easier to understand and it decreases the likelihood of being misunderstood. Be aware of your audience Having an effective understanding of who you are communicating with, enables you to tailor your message to meet the needs of your target audience. The message you are communicating should be engaging. This helps to make sure that your message is received and understood in the way you intended. In conclusion, it is essential to maintain a courteous demeanour while communicating with others. Remember, effective communication is a continuous journey that requires practice, patience and a genuine interest in connecting with others. By incorporating these habits into our daily interactions, we pave the way to success by developing an invaluable problem-solving asset.

                     Zimbabwe can’t develop on the back of slave labour
                    ","IT is heartening that President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa actually believes that workers are the cornerstone to Zimbabwe attaining its developmental goals. He indicated this to commemorate this year’s Workers Day. The head of State proceeded to “applaud the vital role that labour plays in the realisation of our national development goals”. Wow! However, Mr President, all this is very hard to fathom, taking into consideration the unbelievable poverty and suffering workers in Zimbabwe face each day. How can their dedication and resilience be “applauded and commended” when they are treated as slaves in their own country? Surely, is throwing over two-thirds of the workforce into unimaginable poverty — as they earn below the poverty datum line — a way of showing appreciation for the hardworking men and women? This is also a country in which an estimated 49% of the population lives in extreme poverty — earning, according to the 2023 United Nations classification, less than US$2,57 a day, which is the international poverty line. In other words, anyone taking home less than US$77 a month should consider themselves extremely poor. I actually believe that those falling in this category in Zimbabwe are far more than the 49% official figure, since this was for 2020 when economic factors such as inflation were at lower levels than today. Right now, the government’s own employees, the civil servants are some of the lowest paid workers not only in the country, but also in the southern African region. Despite endless promises of improved remuneration, as well as other so-called “non-monetary benefits”, such as solar systems for their homes, 50 000 housing units and others, virtually nothing has been fulfilled. After deductions, the majority of civil servants in Zimbabwe do not take home more than US$200 per month. According to the latest Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency figures, an average Zimbabwean required over ZWL$700 000 (which is around US$50) in the month of March 2024 for food alone. This means that, just to purchase food, a family of six needed at least US$300. How many workers in Zimbabwe, whether in the public or private sector, are not earning anywhere near this amount just to cover basic food only? But as we all know, “man cannot live on bread alone”. One needs to pay for accommodation, utilities, school fees for children (and other education-related costs), transport and clothing, among many other expenses. How are the vast majority of Zimbabwean workers expected to survive? Based on several reports I have come acorss, the situation is even worse for those employed by Chinese companies operating in Zimbabwe. These employees are some of the most abused and exploited in the country. Not only are they reportedly compelled to work under the most hazardous conditions (without sufficient protective gear), but are also poorly paid and, in most cases, not even paid their salaries for months. In fact, reports are awash of workers being physically assaulted by their Chinese bosses. The most harrowing message I received was from an employee who alleged that a woman at one lithium mine died after the company refused to provide transport when she had been referred to Harare for critical medical attention. This resulted in flash protests in the workers’ compound against the mining company, which were ruthlessly crushed allegedly with the aid of local law enforcement agents. All this is taking place while these Chinese mining companies are unapologetically pillaging our mineral resources worth billions of dollars with scant regard for human rights and environmental considerations. The fact that these employers are permitted or even protected by the Government of Zimbabwe paints a disturbing picture of the general plight of workers across the country who are viewed as nothing more than slave labour. Both the government and the private sector have adopted an “if you don’t like it, the door is open” attitude. So, when Mnangagwa talks about valuing workers as the “cornerstone to Zimbabwe’s aspirations towards attaining its developmental goals’, what exactly does he mean? Is he talking in terms of developing the country on the same lines as the transatlantic slave trade — when countries like the US recorded phenomenal economic growth on the back of slave labour? Are those Mnangagwa’s aspirations? Is this how Zimbabwe is expected to achieve Mnangagwa’s envisioned Vision 2030? All I can say to you is: “Shame on you!” Tendai Ruben Mbofana is a social justice advocate and writer.

Robust and powerful global media institutions like BBC, CNN, Agence France Press and Reuters, among others were born. While the term “Press freedom” maybe relative, it serves to remind the world of the role of the media as the fourth estate. As this happens, environmental journalists in many countries have been captured, while journalism as profession is at cross-roads, safety of journalists is at stake, and language has been used as a distabilising tool. This article aims to unpack why developed countries, especially Western rich nations, which are also the major sources of carbon emissions, seek to control other nations by using scientific and quasi-scientific terms and language for hegemonic purposes. While developed countries stand accused of the above machinations, developing countries with toxic and repressive media laws have invested in the grim fear factor, cowing journalists into a narrow, tunnel-minded and subjective lot. Many developing countries witness a plunder of natural resources in the extractive sector, human rights abuses and casualties, while journalists have been hammered into disinformation tools, bellowing for their supper, trading their souls for pieces of silver and soup. While Press freedom is vital, there is no freedom in Press freedom, it is just a mirage and myth. This is because the media has the power to expose the looting in the extractive sector, it is either they keep mouths zipped or they report falsehoods, praising systems that impoverish citizens or they pay the price of reporting as it is. For these reasons journalists around the world are compromised, pay allegiance to powerful looting cartels, use twisted words and logic, a culture of lies, deceit and lack of depth, while contributing to disinformation and misinformation, communication massaging and mischief, leading to crass linguistic miscarriage. Every situation is stage managed, doctored and choreographed, with grandstanding overtaking logic and burying the truth in the process. With language of capitalism in the form of green propaganda, sometimes referred to as lexical creativity or green discourses on the rise, information has been compromised, with no knowledge on knowledge economy, contributing to linguistic consequences and death of objectivity. Rich-polluting multinational conglomerates with money to broadcast, have disseminated concerns related to climate issues and they currently manipulate people in the developing world by persuading them to think in particular ways using language that conceals their ideological and hegemonic purposes. In this view, it is the rich and powerful countries that have largely participated in polluting the earth at the same time using language to manipulate weaker and poor nations. The massive linguistic invasion in the public sphere may have major ideological effects — that is, they can help to produce and reproduce unequal power relations between social classes, women and men, and ethnic/cultural majorities and minorities through the ways in which they represent things and positions of people. Adoption of such communicative clusters like “green”, “eco” and “carbon” is designed to depict nature, colour and images of the environment as peaceful and serene. The online green dictionary has taken language and communication by storm and utilised the role of compounding to churn out creative lexico-grammatical terms like “carbon footprints”, ‘green discourses”, “eco-culture”, “carbon emergency” and “green buying and living”, among a host of others. While rich polluting nations and companies use language and other means to manipulate people’s minds and shape their thinking, developing countries maximise on corruption, depletion of natural resources and perpetuate environmental crimes, by promoting gutter journalism to praise sing and misinform the public. State apparatus is used to protect corrupt government officials by harassing and jailing journalists for exposing environmental crimes. Both rich carbon emitting nations and repressive governments in developing countries are promoting environmental crises using money, language and repressive laws to make life difficult for professional journalists. While anti-conservationists hide behind linguistic clusters like “green” or “eco”, looters of State resources in developing countries target journalists who cross their path by exposing corrupt officials. While it is the duty of the environmental journalists to unmask environmental crimes in the extractive sector, using the same language that is used by powerful nations to camouflage their emission behaviours, it takes the use of the same linguistic tools and apparatus to correct these wrongs of generated linguistic crimes. Rich polluting nations advertise heavily, market aggressively and have strong media institutions, powerful communicators and linguists to support their cause and keep the world diverted from their emission crimes. Their language use is over-repeated until it sounds true. In developing countries, environmental journalists have no protection, therefore, they report environmental crimes at their own peril. The linguistic propaganda from developed countries is so powerful because it is backed by statistics, practical examples, financial resources and highly sponsored conferences, among others. This language is designed to have impact on its users and they continue generating new green vocabularies leading to linguistic aberration. Green propaganda has permeated every facet of language use, with terms like “resilience”, “sustainable”, “adaptation”and “climate action and justice” being more prominent, tired and overused. Environmental journalists and the journalism profession are at a crossroad, with the profession more dangerous than ever before. Environmental journalists need protection globally as falsehoods and disinformation stink to high heavens of which some governments are hiding behind this to justify sovereignty and heritage while plundering natural resources as if there is no tomorrow. Natural resources are finite and environmental journalists are critical not only in exposing environmental crimes, but also in contributing to environmental literacy, education, awareness, knowledge and information.

                     Is latest global steady economic growth real?
                    ","DESPITE having endured many major challenges and setbacks over the past half a decade ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the Eastern wars (Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza) and the raging climate crisis, the global economic outlook shows a possible steady growth, at least according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD comprises of 38 member countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It is a forum whose member countries describe themselves as committed to democracy and the market economy, providing a platform to compare policy experiences and seek answers to common problems. It also seeks to identify good practices and co-ordinate domestic and international policies of its members. Most OECD members are described as high-income economies ranked as very high on the Human Development Index and are regarded as developed countries. In short, most of its member countries are involved in the ongoing major wars in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Eastern Africa. And the economic projection may be part of the propaganda ahead of several major elections. Or maybe, it is just how they choose to see the situation despite that the wars are taking a huge toll on economies. Nonetheless, considering that most major global economies will hold elections this year — if the projections are anything to go by — this shows that economies have become increasingly resilient to major shocks. It may also mean that they have found ways of navigating some emerging challenges that threatened economic recovery after the COVID-19-induced pandemic. It may also mean that global economies have found opportunities in some of the major wars with the economic benefits far outweighing the negative impacts. Some literature shows that the impact of external wars on economic growth tends to be primarily temporary as markets quickly shift to absorb the war industry into their arms and become part of their major sectors. The war industry, despite its harmfulness to life, traumatising effect, economic disruption, immorality and humanitarian impact, is seen by some dirty investors as an opportunity for quick money and more profitable because of the unchecked government expenditure. The excessively high-profit margins are seen as among the reasons wars become protracted. Nonetheless, the global economy is continuing to grow at a modest pace, according to the OECD’s latest economic outlook. The economic outlook also projects steady global gross domestic product growth of 3,1% in 2024, the same as the 3,1% in 2023, followed by a slight pick-up to 3,2% in 2025. The organisation further notes that the impact of tight monetary conditions continues to be felt in Western markets, particularly in housing and credit markets, but global activity is proving relatively resilient, the decline in inflation continues and private sector confidence is improving. Real incomes are expected to rise in many OECD countries as inflation moderates and trade growth has turned positive. The outlook continues to differ across countries, with weaker outcomes in many advanced economies, especially in Europe and strong growth in the United States and many emerging market economies. Whether this outlook reflects reality or not, the organisation notes that significant uncertainties remain due to the economic instability in China, global wars and a lack of disposable income among households. Inflation may remain higher for longer thus resulting in slower-than-expected reductions in policy interest rates and leading to further financial vulnerabilities. Slow economic growth in China due to the persistent weakness in property markets or smaller-than-anticipated fiscal support over the next two years could disrupt global growth. Current major wars and geopolitical tensions also remain a persistent significant risk to economic activity and inflation, particularly the ongoing conflicts in the Middle Eastern and Eastern Europe and their logistical impact on the Black and Red Seas. Whether it is by design or default, there is no mention of addressing or stopping the major wars among the recommendations provided by the OECD as a means to sustain the projected economic growth. It instead highlights the need for durable reduction in inflation, establish a budgetary path to address rising fiscal pressures, and undertake reforms that improve prospects for medium-term growth. “The foundations for future output and productivity growth need to be strengthened by ambitious structural policy reforms to improve human capital and take advantage of technological advances,” says OECD chief economist Clare Lombardelli. The International Monetary Fund provides a sobering and more objective economic outlook which shows that future growth prospects are souring. Global growth will slow to just above 3% by 2029, according to their latest World Economic Outlook report. This is threatening to reverse improvements to living standards, and the unevenness of the slowdown between richer and poorer nations could limit the prospects for global income convergence. It recommends strengthening and promoting the key drivers of economic growth which includes labour, capital and productivity as a way out of the potential economic crisis.

                     The language of success
                    ","AT times, we need to break out from our norm into a life of adventure, risk, happiness, newness and true potential. There are times when we walk in life bored and without looking forward to anything exciting at all. At times, we reach a plateau and we move in auto pilot; doing the same things over and over again. A good example is when we go to a job every day. We know what we should do and we do it without even thinking at times. It is no longer exciting but a cold routine, we have the skill and it looks like we do not need any creative thought to it. Such is life! The question becomes: How do we break that norm and create our new normal? Drop the word “fine” When we greet people, their most obvious response is “I am fine!” Stop and think. What does that really mean? Most people settle in that zone called fine. It is generally good. There are a number of terms that depict this level and these are “OK”, “fine”, “ordinary”, “acceptable”, “normal” and “average”. Here your mind tells you that things have always been like this! Things do not change or will not change and let us accept them as they are. You are the one to make things change. American entrepreneur, author, and motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, you do not become successful by chance but by change — change to an extraordinary, exuberant, epic, adventurous life. Get into fun, freedom and fulfilment! Get to new things. Take a risk, scuba dive, do not settle for less, break your own record, invent more, break old patterns or paradigms, create new rituals, make more profit, add one hour to your reading schedule, work harder and more wisely and create new friends. Consciously enlarge your business networks, travel to new places and spice up your love life. Do not settle for the “OK”, but go for more in life. The new money language There are times when you feel there is a lid or cap on your money. You cannot go beyond a certain limit. You have been earning so much over some time and it seems you have reached your perimeter. If I would ask: How much are out earning now? For how long have you been in that same stream? Blow-off the lid to your current cash flow into your life. You can have more. Increase your belief.  Increase wealth or prosperity consciousness. Financial stagnation needs increased faith, fights and replacing your old monitory mental files. Create new targets and work more. Set new financial dreams. Double or triple your financial targets. See yourself earning double what you currently earn and your mind will figure out how you are to make that. See yourself rich and walking in financial freedom and independence. Replace disempowering thoughts with positive thinking. Shed negative friends, habits, spend less, spend wisely, learn more to earn more, increase your net worth by growing your networks. Have more streams of income. Create more opportunities for self-development. Replace all liabilities with assets.  Liabilities are things that take away money from you and assets bring value to you. Dream again Probably people that are above 65 years would think they are old enough not to dream again and the young think there is still more time on their side. So, these two categories leave everything to chance.  Nothing comes by chance, but most fortunes come by change. See yourself with new dreams, more money and better health. Go back to school. Get back into the game of life. Do not marvel on your past successes, create new ones.  Get into the groove. Dance again at 89. Renew your marriage vows at 75. Find new love. Do it! Dreaming anew makes you look forward to better things ahead. In his motivational talks, American politician and motivational speaker Les Brown usually says when the end comes, let it find you climbing new mountains and not sliding down the old ones. Do not let death find you on your death bed, but let it find you in your field working on your passion fervently. Speak positively to yourself Most people suffer from what has been called inferiority complex. They think they are not good enough, they are ugly and they are too short. If I may ask you, did you create yourself? It is definitely no! Now, why waste your time on things you can not change? See the beauty in you! See the masterpiece from the Maker! Do not wait to be told by someone that you are beautiful. Some think they are too fat to be loved. Whereas others think they are to blame for not being married. Do not wait for love. Love yourself. Give yourself more love. Others think they are too thin to be in love. Whereas some think they are too short to feature on the outer cover of a magazine. Stop wasting time and start living your life! Tell you what? Self-blame adds nothing good to your life. This is your life, live it to the best. Do not waste time thinking what others are thinking about you. I too suffered all that same until I woke up, dusted myself and I said, “Jonah, it is time to rock! Let’s do this!” If I had believed all those stories, I would not be writing for this column. I would not have published my books. Worse still, when I stood in front of people my head  would spin and mind just froze, but I had to tell myself that, “Jonah if you continue in this kind of mediocre mentality you will amount to nothing. Let us get to work”. Having been in rural areas, worse still in a poor background, my mind would have told me, there are better people to do what you are doing. I fought all those negative thoughts. No need to seek approval Most people do not feel confident until they seek approval from others. Never sell yourself short, you are very special, even if people are not saying so. Never underestimate yourself and never grossly over-estimate other people’s intelligence, you are intelligent in your own right. Never live a wrong script of what others say about you and do not ever live other people’s lives and lies. Kick fear away. Do the very thing that you fear doing and you will learn that there is no lion beyond the veil. It is just an image you have created in your mind. Break all your records. It’s time to live your passion, purpose and do it positively. Jonah Nyoni is an author, speaker, and leadership trainer. He can be contacted on X @jonahnyoni. WhatsApp: +263 772 581 918 "

                     Press Freedom and climate journalism: United in crisis
                    ","JOURNALISM is in crisis, again. The challenges to Press freedom are enormous and multi-faceted and they are deepening — in “free” and open societies as well as autocracies. And there are no simple solutions. For individuals and entire media outlets, the crisis is existential. Nearly 100 journalists and media workers have been killed since the Israel-Gaza war began last October — the worst death toll in a conflict zone in decades, the Committee to Protect Journalists says. Others have been arrested, wounded or gone missing. Family members have also been killed. Some journalists understandably believe they are targeted by Israeli forces. Beyond the threat to life and limb, tens of thousands of media jobs were lost in 2023 and the trend this year is no better. Entire outlets have shut down, or been taken over and/or dumbed down. In our world of enhanced digital chaos and the font of bigotry and disinformation which is social media, audiences are as increasingly fractured as the news outlets they choose to turn to. Bots and AI-generated deep fakes will compound all this politicised confusion and mistrust. Torrents of trivia, subtle scare-mongering and old-fashioned intimidation are a potent combination in the erosion of freedoms and democracy. Russia has seen a mass exodus of journalists. Hong Kong is a shadow of its former self. Myanmar’s regime is a killer and jailer of reporters. But in an increasingly polarised United States, by some counts, over two-thirds of Americans say they don’t trust their mass media. There is excellent reporting happening but much will pass unseen, or dismissed outright. South Africa’s membership-based Daily Maverick shut down for an entire day in April to draw attention to how market failure was endangering independent journalism. “Without journalism, our democracy and economy will break down,” the outlet declared. How all these very different factors are coming together is clearly seen in the media coverage of our global climate breakdown and broader threats to our environment. The environment is not just a highly dangerous topic to cover — sometimes akin to conflict reporting — but it has become a cesspit of corporate propaganda emitted by polluting industries, some of them giant State-owned entities, as well as their partners in disinformation ensconced in politics, academia, “non-profit” foundations and the mass media themselves. Unesco is dedicating World Press Freedom Day this year to the importance of journalism and freedom of expression in the context of the current global environmental crisis. As Unesco says: “Independent journalists as well as scientists are crucial actors in helping our societies to separate facts from lies and manipulation in order to take informed decisions, including about environmental policies. “Investigative journalists are also shedding light on environmental crimes, exposing corruption and powerful interests, and sometimes paying the ultimate price for doing their job.” As India, the world’s largest democracy, holds elections 10 years after Narendra Modi first took over as prime minister, Reporters Without Borders noted that at least 13 of the 28 journalists killed in India since then were working on stories linked to the environment, mainly land seizures and illegal mining. Several were killed while investigating the so-called sand mafia, an organised crime network supplying the construction industry. Reporters Without Borders ranked India 161st out of 180 countries in its 2023 World Press Freedom Index. In the Global South, indigenous, local, and independent journalists and communicators are particularly vulnerable to violence and intimidation while working in remote areas without adequate backup and resources. But in the world’s industrialised democracies — those that blazed the trail of bio-diversity mass extinction, pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases overheating our planet — major media outlets are actively aiding and abetting fossil fuel companies by partnering them. As laid clear in a report by the outlets Drilled and DeSmog, many major media outlets have “an internal brand studio that crafts editorials, videos, even events and entire podcasts for advertisers, many of which are fossil fuel companies”. “The likes of Politico, Reuters, Bloomberg, the NYT, the Washington Post and the Financial Times are all creating content for oil companies that directly contradicts what their climate reporters are publishing. And we know from peer-reviewed research that at most one-third of people can actually tell the difference between advertorial content and reporting.” Journalists, particularly those covering the climate crisis and collapse of eco-systems, also have to confront those almost intangible contradictions that thwart efforts to engage and inform the public. How does one communicate the magnitude of the dangers facing us and our planet to a global audience already bowed down under a barrage of awfulness? How does one resist what one US political scientist referred to as the “banality of crazy”? He was referring to Donald Trump’s violent, sexist and racist rhetoric which has been heard so often that it sometimes barely stirs a media reaction, but the phrase could be used to describe other kinds of dangerously acceptable new-normal. There is no one easy answer to all this. Freedom of the Press rests on just that. It also depends on our own integrity and credibility. - Farhana Haque Rahman "

                     Is Zim opposition still left-leaning?
                    ","THE May Day celebrations in Zimbabwe confirmed one thing: the beginning of the end of the relationship between the opposition and the unionised workers in the country. It was a bad day for the opposition and a curse for the future. It was curious that the main opposition party did not give a solidarity statement at the May Day celebrations at Gwanzura Stadium in Highfield, Harare. This is despite the fact, the opposition MDC which has since morphed into a number of factions was originally midwifed by the trade unions. It was the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) that in 1999 convened the National Working Peoples Convention (NWPC) which among its resolutions was for ZCTU to consider forming a political party that carried the aspirations of workers. To all intents and purposes, MDC was a left-leaning political party. A party that had workers, students and peasants’ interests at its core. Over the years, the party split over personality and ideological clashes among the top leaders. However, until 2018 it still had a semblance of being a leftist party. Human rights activist and independent blogger Takura Zhangazha encapsulated well the changes in the opposition in his blog. He wrote: “As we proceeded with not only the formation of a working peoples political party and constitutional reform via referendum campaigns in 2000, we also became aware of what was a third hand in our activism. This was of the white liberals who had access not only to money but also international foreign policy support. “We could not easily fend these comrades off. They had embedded themselves within our popular support and eventually decided to influence the Morgan Tsvangirai leadership team from any leftist leanings.” I would add, it was not only the white liberals but also a motley of black nouveau riche who could not help, but became even more liberal than the whites. Secondly, the rise of personality cults within the opposition is not based on any ideological inclination but populism. These developments have led leftist Zimbabweans on the crossroads. A decision has to be made whether to be swallowed by the tide of liberalism or join the bandwagon of ideologically bankrupt populism? Yes, there is also the third option, leftist reorganising and getting back to the basics. I can’t help but borrow once more from Zhangazha’s blog on this. He wrote: “But what is important is that the labour movement survived the fact of its support for a new political party. The ZCTU still exists. And for that we are grateful.” Zhangazha is also aware of how it is not easy and a number of things have to change among the workers if they have to rest. “The only challenge that appears to be emerging is that labour rights activism is increasingly being diminished mainly because workers are no longer as conscious as they used to be of their rights.  But also, because scarce employment opportunities have made unionism abstract or unimportant.  “Most employees in the contemporary world no longer care about workers’ rights.  They simply want to keep their jobs and never question or organise on behalf of collective worker interests,” Zhangazha opined. As Zhangazha correctly observed, many workers do not think that they are simply labourers in the true sense of the word because of the positions they hold. They are oblivious to the fact that most are only one paycheck away from poverty. If that point becomes clearer to those in lofty position and opinion leaders then we would understand the reasons for leftist political parties are still unfulfilled a quarter of the century later after the formation of the MDC. Workers, students and peasants are worse off than they were 25 years ago. Many earn far below the poverty datum line, education has been privatised, the public health system is in comatose and the majority of pensioners now need to depend on social welfare. Now is the time for the left to awaken from their slumber or the lull by liberals of trickle-down economics. It needs no further exploration that the time is ripe for the working class to unite and rescue themselves from the clutches of neoliberal economics. Is it not shocking to Zimbabwean workers that employees in the United States, the United Kingdom, German or the Nordic countries have minimum wages, basic health insurance and even free tertiary education? Why should Zimbabweans be going where others are coming from? It is time that workers of Zimbabwe unite and realise they are their own saviours. That politicians and political parties should be voted because their policies are aligned to the aspirations of the people, not because they are handsome or popular. It came out very clearly from the ZCTU that workers are struggling and cannot make ends meet. Working conditions are getting worse and there is no pension to talk of. Now the ball should be in its court and they organise a second NWPC for a way forward. After all is said and done, all the big political parties in Zimbabwe are just different shades of neoliberals, they all worship capital and see privatisation as a panacea to all the economic ills the country has. We need new politics. We need new politicians. It is a sad conclusion that the leftists have changed, they have gone to bed with capital. The workers themselves have to come back to rescue the situation. It is a truism that it is either you are at the table or on the table. Capitalists don’t think twice before they have workers for dinner. Workers now, more than ever, have to be organised and be at the table themselves or very soon the tribe known as trade unionists will be extinct. There it is — workers of the world unite and we only have the chains to break. "

                     New and living way
                    ","TEACHING prayer in ministry or denominational setting is a bit easier because we then pray. On a platform like this, I appeal to you to stand with us and pray especially now that we are breaking down the walls of legalism, tradition and religion. Let me enlighten you a bit more. Since satan has seen that the church is praying, he will not necessarily stop you from praying but leave you praying with dissatisfaction because no answer will be coming from God. As long as the church is bitter with God and the cloud of darkness is left uncovered by the truth or rightly divided Word of Truth, the church will be always complaining and some will leave the faith. Complaining or murmuring is fertile ground for not realising the promises of God. We are careful not to be so much engrossed in the mechanical aspects of prayer, thereby defeating the fellowship the Father intended to have with His children. Many panic and try all sorts of antics like covering up for God that the situation was resolved. By night, witch doctors will be busy helping “Christians”. An act will be put up by testimonies in the church for a “breakthrough” that came from the devil. At some point a whole assembly will be nicodemously visiting the same witch doctor or false prophet/ess. What was previously a Christian assembly becomes a cult. Where God is, you do not need to cover up for Him. Sometimes the mechanics we mentioned earlier are pulled out. This is where we end up having satanic things like dangerous prayers, back to sender or the sorcerer must die. God wants the sorcerer, witch doctor, wizard or any perceived enemy to be saved. 1 Timothy 2:4, reads, “Who [God] will [desires to] have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.” After being saved, the believer has to know the truth. Prophecy had already foretold in the following rhetoric question, Ezekiel 18:23, “Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?” Other mechanics used are like, let us use time windows when sorcerers are busy like midnight or at 1 am. When you fail to wake up to pray that slot, the whole day you will be seeing satan and defeat. Faith will be driven by fear. Some resort to try entice God with a vow and call it the prayer of Hannah or the blessing of Jabez. The devil likes it so much when a believer has a mindset that the Father is so hard to get answers from. He really smiles when we conclude that we are not doing enough before we pray because he knows we will not receive. He smiles when you conclude that you are cursed and always looking for being blessed. All these have no place in the New Testament. The Gospel of Christ is the blessing. We read Acts 3:26, “Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.” Space will not permit to quote from the epistles and letters how we are already blessed. A believer is blessed because salvation is the blessing. Everything that comes from God is by grace and, therefore, a gift without human effort. Apostle Paul tells us in Ephesians 2:8-9, “[8] For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.” We endeavour to teach in love and avoid examples that point towards any denomination or ministry or person. We do not look for powerful believers or prayer warriors. Is that so? We pray to a powerful Almighty God and Father. Do not discredit yourself. Should you have prayer partners? Yes. God is looking to develop your own prayer life. It will be unfolding more and more as we continue with this series. Jesus explained the spirit of the Scriptures in Luke 9:54-56, “[54] And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did? [55] But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. [56] For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.” The Bible is clear that we are not fighting human beings. We are in the day of salvation. What we have already quoted shows that God does not want your enemy to die. 2 Corinthians 6:2, teaches, “(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)” We have crossed from death to life and cannot pray according to the deadness of sin. Our Way is new and alive according to Hebrews 10:19-20, “[19] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, [20] By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;” We will explain this more next week so that we do not try fables like through and by the blood of Jesus. If you are born again, the blood of Jesus puts you in the living way. The Bible is clear that we pray in the name of Jesus. We don’t strengthen prayer by praying in the name and by the blood of Jesus. Selah! Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen. Grace and peace be multiplied to you through knowledge.

                     When the mind needs a helping hand: Exploring  the world of neuropsychology
                    ","HAVE you ever felt like your memory isn’t as sharp as it used to be, or found yourself struggling to focus or switch between tasks? Maybe you have noticed it’s harder to follow conversations or plan things out like before. If these challenges sound familiar, it might be time to consider seeing a neuropsychologist. Neuropsychologists are the detectives of the psychology world. They specialise in understanding how the brain and behaviour are connected. Imagine your brain is like a complicated highway system. Neuropsychologists figure out where the traffic jams are, why they are happening, and how they are affecting your daily life. They work closely with people who have faced a variety of challenges, from those born with conditions like autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder to those who have suffered injuries or illnesses that affect the brain such as strokes, brain tumours or dementia. When you visit a neuropsychologist, they will guide you through a series of tests. These are not tests you can pass or fail but are designed to measure how well different parts of your brain are working. You might solve some puzzles, answer questions, or use blocks or computers for tasks that seem simple but reveal a lot about how your brain processes information. These tests help pinpoint the specific areas where you are having trouble, which is crucial in planning the best treatment or strategies to help you manage or overcome these challenges. The field of neuropsychology in Zimbabwe is growing, bringing new opportunities for specialised care. In 2021, Zimbabwe registered its first neuropsychologist, Kudzai Nyakusendwa, and the University of Zimbabwe began offering a degree in this field. These developments mean that more people can now access care that understands and integrates their cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. It is a big step forward because it opens up previously scarce and locally unavailable services, helping to ensure that neuropsychological care is more relevant and accessible to everyone. Even if you are not ready to see a neuropsychologist, there are simple things you can do everyday to keep your mind sharp. Taking short breaks throughout your day can greatly benefit your mental health and cognitive abilities. Practising deep breathing for a few minutes, stretching or taking a brief walk can refresh your mind and improve both focus and creativity. Short breaks help to mentally reset and can make you more productive when you return to your tasks. Setting aside time to let your thoughts drift freely can be surprisingly beneficial. This practice, often referred to as “mind-wandering”, can enhance creativity and problem-solving. Allowing your mind to wander can lead to moments of insight and innovation, similar to anecdotes about great thinkers like Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs, who embraced periods of solitude and reflection. Everyday, people make numerous small decisions that, although seemingly minor, can deplete mental energy, leaving less for more critical decisions. To combat this, try simplifying your daily choices. For instance, choosing your meals for the week or selecting your outfits in advance are practical steps you can take to minimise decision fatigue, thus preserving your mental energy for more significant decisions. The brain tends to be most alert and rested after a good night’s sleep. Therefore, it is beneficial to schedule the most demanding tasks for the first part of the day. Tackling challenging tasks in the morning ensures you address them when your cognitive abilities are at their peak. Understanding the role of neuropsychologists and leveraging their expertise can significantly improve your quality of life if you are dealing with brain-related challenges. It is essential to ensure that any neuropsychologist you consult is registered with the Allied Health Council of Zimbabwe to guarantee that you receive competent and professional care. "

                     Winter wheat preps: What farmers should prioritise
                    ","THIS year's summer season witnessed diverse and contentious rainfall patterns, which are largely attributed to El Niño-induced droughts that have disproportionately affected smallholder farmers. In early April, government acknowledged the necessity for assistance, as it designated the prevailing drought a state of disaster and estimated that approximately US$2 billion will be required to provide humanitarian aid. As the current wild season is almost on its periphery, ahead of us is yet another exciting winter season for winter cropping to which participating farmers are currently gearing up. Winter cropping consists of cultivating crops tolerant to sub-zero or near-freezing temperatures for their growth and development cycle and requires considerably lower temperatures to initiate their reproductive phase, a phenomenon known as vernalization in grains. In Zimbabwe, winter crops that are predominantly cultivated include wheat, barley and oats as grains and diverse horticultural crops. Among these, wheat is the most significant cultivated winter crop in Zimbabwe. In fact, wheat is the second most prominent “grain crop” after maize, while it is the third most prominent crop in general, after maize and tobacco in Zimbabwe. Its significance alludes to the ever-increasing demand for flour-made foods, such as bread, biscuits and breakfast cereals. Zimbabwe requires approximately 350 000 tonnes of wheat annually to sustain itself, which is difficult to achieve. Nonetheless, the 2022/23 season became a historical breakthrough when this target was surpassed, with much credit going to the government for its pragmatic investment in this crop and the agricultural sector. Unfortunately, unlike other global regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as the Western Coast of South Africa, which receives winter rainfall, Zimbabwe’s winter season is exclusively characterised by limited to no rainfall. Thus, winter wheat farming in Zimbabwe is entirely based on irrigation, which, in turn, systematically excludes numerous farmers who rely on dryland farming. In other words, the major ticket for winter wheat farming in Zimbabwe is the availability of irrigation facilities, which tend to favour commercial farmers while leaving out smallholder farmers. In this regard, winter farming may not necessarily underperform to the extent of summer performance. In general, in wheat farming and winter farming, sufficient preparation is essential because of the instant switch from summer to winter. Unlike summer crops, which have several planting dates throughout the season, wheat is highly selective on planting dates and requires early planting. In Zimbabwe, recommended early planting dates for wheat range from mid-April to mid-May, which reduces the two major risks of missing cold temperatures at the vernalisation stage and the coincidence of summer rains during harvesting. Additionally, in some cases, the wheat planting window may coincide with the harvesting of summer crops, which might be laborious for farmers. Thus, it is imperative for farmers to take note of proper preparations and here we highlight some tips. They should also ensure that all previous loans and debts are cleared. Self-financing can be complicated because of the large investment demand, particularly on a commercial scale. Proper preparation prevents poor performance. With proper preparation, wheat farmers have a great chance of achieving their wheat yield potential during the rough dry season. This will be crucial to meet the country’s wheat output targets and a repeat of the 2022/23 season’s breakthrough, which will halt the continuous dependence on imported wheat because Zimbabwe has the capacity to produce its own.

                     Zim’s moving coffins: The untold story of targets
                    ","A ZEBRA Kiss bus driver, Mike Makwara (49), was slapped with a two-year jail term for causing a fatal accident along the Harare-Nyamapanda Highway at the height of a route war. Makwara was banned for life from driving heavy and public service vehicles. On January 12, 2023, along the Harare-Nyamapanda Highway, Makwara was driving a bus belonging to Zebra Kiss heading towards Mutoko. Another bus from Rimbi Travel and Tours was also heading in the same direction. The Rimbi bus driver wanted to overtake but was blocked by Makwara who kept driving in the middle of the road and at times encroaching onto the opposite lane. As a result of continuous obstruction, the Rimbi bus rammed into a tipper truck, killing the conductor on the spot. All this was captured on a phone camera by a concerned passenger. The video went viral igniting anger among citizens who condemned the bus driver’s terrible behaviour. According to the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ), about 90% of road accidents are a result of human error. “I admit that human error is the major cause of road accidents in the country but of late, the rate at which buses are involved in road accidents is alarming, there is more to it,” a director at Arrive Alive Awareness, Isaac Simbarasi said. In April last year, a Timboon bus disaster claimed 13 lives in an accident that occurred between Chivhu and Murambinda due to speeding. Since then, the frequency of road accidents on local roads has been unbearable. A number of drivers, however, revealed that the issue of “targets” should be stopped since they cause bus drivers to operate under a lot of pressure. “We work on targets and most of the times we are under pressure to achieve that or we lose our jobs,” said a bus driver who plies the Harare-Mutare route. “My target per day is US$500 and I have to meet that. The employer gives me 10%of that. If I surpass the target, the remainder is mine. If I work for 10 days meeting that target it means I have US$500 commission, also the surplus is mine.” According to the World Health Organisation, around 1,3 million people are killed each year on global roads, while a further 20 to 50 million are injured each year around the world. In Zimbabwe, according to TSCZ, an average of five people die everyday on the country’s roads, with an estimated 2 000 people dying each year on the country’s roads. Speaking during a visit to the Timboon bus accident scene, Transport minister Felix Mhona emphasised the need to have all buses installed with speed limit devices. The call has, however, fallen on deaf ears as Zimbabwe’s roads have been turned into racecourses all in the name of meeting targets. Pirate taxi drivers who ply the 74km Marondera-Harare route said they were forced to do five trips per day to meet their targets. They drive the popular Toyota Pro-Box vehicles ferrying 11 people instead of five. “Our target is US$50 per day and we are forced to do an average of four trips (to and from) per day. Four people are in the boot and each trip gives me at least US$26. From that I deduct US$3 for the touts, US$4 for the (Goromonzi) tollgate, US$3 to bribe the police at a roadblock, already I am left with US$16 without talking of fuel. “I have to sacrifice one of two trips for the fuel, we have to speed to meet the target. The vehicle owner will be waiting for his full amount of money,” said a Pro-box mushikashika driver. Instead of being given commission, pirate taxi driver are given a day to operate within a week for their remuneration. “Most vehicle owners pay us by giving us the vehicle a day per week. So I have to maximise and get more money to add to the surplus I get during these six days. Some opt to give us 20%  of the total amount earned that month,” said the pirate taxi driver. Mhona said government was mulling the introduction of a bus timetable system in a bid to deal with the rising deaths on the highways. Passenger Association of Zimbabwe’s Tafadzwa Goliath said: ""The bus timetable system is recommended as it stops bus drivers from competing for passengers. Yesteryear, for example, a traveller in Rusape would know that his or her bus would be at the rank at around 11am from Harare. It was systematic. The issue of money targets need to be investigated by authorities."" Government has failed to walk the talk on reining in speeding public transport drivers. The highways have turned bloody due to accidents caused by speeding triggered by targets. “For now, we continue to lose lives on the country’s roads if authorities do not step up and avert the problem being triggered by targets. It is now a common feature for a bus driver to hit the 140km per hour mark as they race at the mercy of innocent passengers,” Simbarasi added. "

                     ZiG will stand or fall on public trust, nothing else
                    ","THE manner in which the government introduced the new currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), is proof that little or nothing has been learnt from previous similar experiences. Zimbabweans are still traumatised by the destruction of wealth that was caused by five other attempts to rein in galloping inflation including the introduction of bearer cheques and bond notes. At the time of writing the black market was setting the pace, which is partly a reflection of the public’s mistrust of government. A course correction, in communication and confidence building measures, is required to avoid further currency weakening. To assuage the traumatised public all tools of moral suasion should have been deployed to get buy-in from all stakeholders before and after the launch. Pointing out that ZiG is backed by gold does not explain why bond notes that were supposedly backed by a US$200 million Afreximbank bond facility failed dismally. The recent threats made by government officials, betray lack of faith in gold’s ability to back the new currency. Force, a trusted weapon, is being summoned to back ZiG. The arrest of black-market currency dealers is proof that there is a chink in this strategy. It does not help that there is suspicion that currency traders represent the politically connected.  The one element that has sustained money since ancient times is trust. From the days when human beings used cowrie shells, then grain and livestock in exchange for goods and services, trust has been the bedrock upon which money stands.  Money, as Yuval Noah Harari (Sapiens) and Jacob Goldstein (Money) argue in their books, is a fiction whose value is sustained by our common imagination. “In other words, money isn’t a material reality — it is a psychological construct,” argues Harari in his seminal book. Harari continues: “Money is not coins and bank notes. Money is anything that people are willing to use in order to represent systematically the value of other things for the purpose of exchanging goods and services.” Only 8% of the world’s money exists in notes and coins. The bulk of it exists only in computer servers. It is trust that binds this fiction together. For this social construct and fiction to hold all stakeholders must willingly go along. The fiction is sustained by general consent and never by decree. In our environment where confidence in government is non-existent trust is actually a currency. Since the launch of ZiG both the RBZ and government have done little to promote this currency. For instance, ZiG notes and coins came into circulation on Tuesday April 30, and yet no visible promotion had been rolled out. Persuading people accustomed to using the greenback to adopt a local currency after dollarisation is a Herculean task. International Monetary Fund data indicates that there have only been two countries that have successfully de-dollarised, namely Israel and Poland. Zimbabwe is following the script of all countries that failed to de-dollarise, namely, “administrative enforcements without fully restoring confidence in the local currency or eliminating the underlying instability that led to dollarisation in the first place.” The trust chasm between the government and the public is humongous largely because of government’s dismal track record. There are other questions that have layered this mistrust, namely the elephant in the room pointed out by ex-RBZ governor Gideon Gono. The RBZ has no autonomy and it is hard to dismiss the suspicion that the President has unfettered access to national coffers. Chris Mutsvangwa’s allegation that gold was stolen from RBZ vaults during the late former President Robert Mugabe’s era was inopportune. Having the President’s son as deputy Finance minister erodes public trust. The RBZ Act says the “governor is appointed by the President after consultation with the minister.” The optics are just not right. Also, the statutory instruments recently enacted to shield parastatals from public scrutiny undermine public trust in our financial governance.   To show full confidence in ZiG all government departments, including local government should conduct transactions in the local currency. Taxes should also be paid 100% in ZiG. It is impossible to overstate the importance of a stable local currency to undergird a vibrant economy, sovereignty and national pride. It is crucial that ZiG earns public trust and be widely used. For this to happen, government and the central bank must solicit public trust through their words and actions. "

                     The power of naming
                    ","NAMES are not just a random collection of letters. Rather they are sign posts that point to who we are and where we come from. From the moment we are born, our names begin to shape our identities. They somewhat predestine us positively or negatively. But what if your name carried more significance than just being a label or you? What if it held the key to your future? Understanding the meaning and significance of a name is like unlocking a treasure trove of understanding the bigger picture beyond naming a thing. Whether we realise it or not; our names hold a great deal of power. They can influence the way we are perceived by others, our sense of self-worth and even our life paths. Since time immemorial, naming has always had been treated with paramount importance. “What is your name?” is a question that you are likely to answer time and again in this life. Aside from making social interactions awkward as well as fostering a way to remember information, names reveal striking information about human psyche, cultural changes, familial lineages as well as geographical variations, among others. This makes our understanding of the power of naming a necessary evil for all us. And you ask, is this necessary? Well, your answer is here and now. I trust your questions will be dealt with and you will appreciate why you need to embrace the power of naming. Allow me to draw to your attention to the fact that naming can have a huge impact on how you perceive and interact with the world around you. The people, food, places and other things that you know is a result of naming. You can make your differentiations and distinctions of things through naming. Naming is, therefore, a rich and complex process. When we start naming the environment and the things within it or the universe correctly, the way we perceive ourselves and our sphere of influence, immediately changes. Just think of the power of saying, “I am a child of God”; “I am a winner”; “I am a leader” or “God is my father.” Hey! Such a mindset will not just help you with a name, it is an identity and a relationship with yourself, your environment and your maker. What then is naming? Let me start off by defining what naming is. Understanding the meaning of naming and significance of our names is like looking up at the sky — it connects us to something more beautiful than ourselves. And just like looking at the sunset, it changes our perspective. Acknowledging and embracing the truth of a name changes our perspective. Undeniably, understanding the meaning and significance of naming also helps us to see our place in the world and our relationship with God. Pedantically, naming is assigning a name to something. Culturally, naming can be seen as a ritual or ceremony in which a person’s name is given or announced.  God formed beasts of the field and birds of the air out of the ground and brought them to Adam so that Adam would name them. The names Adam gave are the names for the beasts of the field and birds of the air to this day. Genesis 2 vs 19b reads, “He brought them to the man to see what he would name them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.” And to us, the names we give or we were given, have a certain aura they create for us. When you grasp the significance of your name, it is like you have discovered a piece of your identity that was hidden from plain sight. Some names have negative or unfortunate meanings, which can be quite a burden to carry around. Imagine having to live with a name like that! But even in those cases, there is an opportunity for redemption. In Isaiah 62:2 there is a line which reads, “And you will be called by a new name.” People can take ownership of their names and redefine what they mean. They can turn their bad news name into a symbol of their resilience and strength or power. It is all about how you choose to approach your name, is it not? There are so many things that are supposed to be yours but the problem is they have no names. Suppose you are a parent and you give birth and name your child as is the norm, that child has been sealed as your own and all things being equal no one can come and claim that child from you unless you are an abusive parent. Suppose you want a wife, a car, a house or any other thing, you need to name the things into existence. If you cannot name it and if you cannot picture it, then you cannot have it. I want you to understand that the nomenclature process encompasses a wide range of disciplines such as etymology, onomastics, toponyms (names of places) and anthroponyms (names of people). Your name did not come by accident and what you do not have is also not by accident. You need to rise up to the occasion and name something. Naming creates critical pillars of our individual as well as collective identity and stirs emotions, fosters connections and promotes inclusivity. The critical canons of this life, opine that, “experience is the best teacher.” We need to be extra cautious when it comes to naming. The names you give are more like rubber stamping a behaviour or character and before you know it, the telltale signs will emerge and will be difficult to thwart. Suffice it to say, names are an incredible part of identity. Name encapsulates identity. What names are attracting your social capital? Well, this is food for thought. Stay intrigued! "
