Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Deputy Minister, Davis Marapira visited the province on Thursday and met farmers at Esigodini Agriculture College who raised concern over the depleting water levels following poor inflows this season due to El-Nino induced drought. Following a tour of winter wheat projects in Matabeleland South and Midlands provinces, Deputy Minister Marapira said the declining water levels would slightly strain the harvest as farmers have to trim the hectarage. Zimbabwe is one of the hardest hit countries in the region and President Mnangagwa has since declared this year’s drought a State of disaster. The country is now pinning its hopes on salvaging yields from crops under irrigation and the winter wheat. Government and private sector players have pumped in significant resources to ensure successful winter wheat production. The target is to plant 120 000 hectares this winter which is expected to give the country 600 000 tonnes of wheat which is well above the 468 000 tonnes produced from 91 000ha last year.   This would be 240 000 tonnes above the minimum of 360 000 tonnes needed for self-sufficiency.  Deputy Minister Marapira said due to the effects of El Nino, farmers used a lot of water during the summer cropping, which has resulted in the decline in water levels. “We are here in Matabeleland South to check on the winter wheat production for the 2024 season. The target for the province was 5 500 ha. Unfortunately farmers used a lot of water during the summer cropping season and as a result some dams do not have enough water to irrigate winter wheat,” he said. Deputy Minister Marapira said some farmers will , not be able to plant this winter while those with water can only plant 3 700ha. “We may have challenges like late input supply hence my ministry is engaging Treasury to make sure that all inputs are paid for and delivered within a reasonable time. Our banks are signing contracts late, which also may affect our winter wheat planting,” he said. Deputy Minister Marapira urged farmers to work harder and ensure winter wheat planting is completed by the end of this month. He also encouraged all stakeholders who are part of the winter wheat production to be active on the ground to make sure that inputs are ready and that there is electricity throughout. During the meeting it emerged that Matabeleland South has so far planted about 500 hectares of wheat. Speaking at the same event, one of the farmers from Matabeleland South Mr Clarkson Matshiya said the shortage of water due to El Nino was negatively affecting a lot of agriculture activities in the province. He said what made the situation worse for the province was that its major dams were supplying water to Bulawayo. Mr Matshiya however, said he hoped the completion of the Lake Gwayi-Shangani project, which is part of the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project will bring a lot of relief to both farmers and Bulawayo residents. The massive water project is expected to ease pressure on Matabeleland South dams such as Mtshabezi, Umzingwane, which are situated in communal areas and support irrigation and livestock projects. Other farmers also called upon the Government to fast track the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme saying this will also assist in improving water supply. – @SikhulekelaniM1.      "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/czi-makes-zig-conversion-proposals/,CZI makes ZiG conversion proposals,"Business Writer BUSINESSES will face severe working capital challenges if the central bank insists on converting outstanding auction allotments into a two-year ZiG denominated non-negotiable certificates of deposit (NNCDs). According to the 2024 Monetary Policy Statement presented by new RBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu, following the establishment of a refined interbank foreign exchange market, all outstanding auction allotments will be converted into ZiG and refunded to recipients at the current interbank exchange rate. The refund will entail the conversion of all outstanding auction allotments into a two-year ZiG-denominated instrument at an interest rate of 7,5 percent per annum. Further, all outstanding payments for foreign exchange purchased by Treasury under the 25 percent surrender requirement will be converted to a ZiG-denominated instrument with a tenor of one year at an interest rate of 7,5 percent per annum. Dr Mushayavanhu justified the conversion and said it “will allow the new system to start on a clean slate using the interbank foreign exchange system”. However, the business community is of the view that, the proposed issuance of two-year non-negotiable certificates of deposits for these obligations means that companies will in principle be deprived of desperately needed working capital for that period, holding back production. A player in the pharmaceutical industry, who requested not to be named, said “the impact is severe for small players because the money is supposed to buy stocks”. “So if you can’t buy stocks then you are out of business. What this means is that many will be forced to borrow if they are to survive,” said the pharmacists. The official also expressed concern on the 7,5 percent interest rate that is being offered which he feared will be eroded by inflation. Economic analyst and Founder & Executive Officer at SME Association of Zimbabwe, Farai Mutambanengwe said the conversion is disruptive to business. “Most of that money is working capital which means it was supposed to buy raw materials now but is being converted to a two-year treasury bill, obviously that’s very disruptive to business,” he said. Busisa Moyo, chairman for the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA) shared the same sentiment and said “the impact will be quite severe because it means that those companies no longer have access to working capital”. “Some of them are already sitting on legacy debt from 2018,” said Moyo. Business lobby group, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) believes the conversion of the outstanding auction bids to NNCDs is an immediate extraction of about US$90 million dollars’ worth of working capital from the manufacturing sector. “The constraint on productive capacity is immense considering the absence and at best high cost of working capital in the market,” said CZI in an NNCD discussion paper seen by this publication. The companies have already sustained significant opportunity costs with the money tied up in unsettled auctions. It will be unfair to load them with additional costs especially given that many other companies have had their auction obligations settled in full via pre-funding arrangements.”  The business grouping said instead of converting the overdue auction allotments, there are alternative ways that will enable companies to mobilise funds without having any impact on ZiG trading. “We believe that these proposals have no downside risk for Treasury. Indeed Treasury will benefit from increased taxes on the production boost that will result from the proposals,” said CZI. The Business Member Organisation (BMO) proposed a set of alternatives to address the issue of outstanding business payments that the central bank want to convert to non-negotiable certificates of deposit (NNCDs). The CZI argues that these alternatives will lead to a faster recovery for affected companies compared to relying solely on NNCDs. According to the CZI, their proposed solutions would avoid negatively impacting the Zimbabwean dollar (ZiG) trading while stimulating the economy by enabling affected businesses to return to full production quickly. Issuing US dollar treasury bills as suggested in one option, would demonstrate the Government’s commitment to upholding the value of the ZiG. This approach is seen as a fairer solution to companies experiencing delays and significant opportunity costs due to unsettled auctions. By settling in USD, the Government would signal confidence in the stability of the ZiG compared to the current practice that some view as expressing a lack of confidence. Another option proposes allowing companies holding NNCDs to use them for settling statutory obligations like taxes owed to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) or electricity bills owed to the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa). This would essentially allow businesses to indirectly offset their debts with the Government, potentially preventing market disruptions upon settlement. Recognising that the blocked USD balances were meant for importing critical supplies, the CZI also proposes converting NNCDs into 360-day letters of credit. This would involve collaborating with one or two local banks to establish a system that grants immediate access to essential raw materials for affected companies. The CZI emphasises that many companies have already had their auction obligations fully settled through pre-funding arrangements. They argue that using NNCDs exclusively would unfairly burden businesses that were not part of those arrangements. By advocating for these alternative solutions, the CZI aims to accelerate economic recovery through a swifter return to full production for Zimbabwean businesses. – Business Weekly    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/vfex-launches-cfds/,VFEX launches CFDs,"Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE Contract for Differences (CFDs) launched by Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube here on Friday marks the operationalisation of the Offshore Financial Services Centre, which would be a catalyst for foreign direct investment. Prof Ncube launched the contract for differences (CFD) at the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX), thereby positioning Zimbabwe as a regional financial hub and attracting both domestic and international investors. Vision Capital Group (VCG) is pioneering the CFD product in partnership with VFEX, which was launched in October 2020 to kick-start the Offshore Financial Services Centre (OFSC) earmarked for the Special Economic Zone SEZ) in Victoria Falls as the Government designated the city as an international financial services centre in the last leg of reforms to make the SEZ attractive to investors. The move is part of efforts to attract global capital and restore foreign investor confidence in Zimbabwe’s capital markets while helping companies raise capital in foreign currency. A CFD is a financial contract that pays the differences in the settlement price between the open and closing trades. CFDs essentially allow investors to trade the direction of securities over the very short-term. They enhance protection of investors’ money given the background of loss of savings in the past as they offer a unique opportunity rather than owning the underlying asset. Market participants buy or sell units to trade based on a particular financial instrument’s underlying price depending on whether they believe its value will go up or down.  Speaking at the launch Prof Ncube said VFEX was strategically placed as a global competitive platform for the trading of stocks in hard currency.  “It gives me great pleasure to be here with you today as we launch a new product on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange, the Contract for Difference. “The birth of VFEX in 2020 was one of the many initiatives implemented by the Government of Zimbabwe to stabilise our economy and attract foreign direct investment,” he said.  “Today, we stand here celebrating the continued growth of VFEX, not only in terms of new listings but also addition of new products. The launch of CFDs on VFEX speaks to the focus of National Development Strategy 1 as this product will deepen financial inclusion and will significantly aid in promoting financial inclusion and literacy. “The trading of CFDS on the VFEX marks a significant milestone in the evolution of our capital markets and reaffirms Zimbabwe’s commitment to fostering innovation and progress in consolidating economic transformation as reiterated in the 2024 national budget,” said Prof Ncube.  He said the introduction of the CFDs trading on the VFEX represents a positive step as it provides investors with versatile and dynamic tools to participate in the financial markets through regulated instruments. The launch of CFDs will enable investors to trade CFDs on a regulated platform and also increase retail participation and aid in financial inclusion. Minister Ncube said investors can gain access to various assets including equities, indices, commodities and currencies without the need for ownership of the underlying asset itself. He said Government has been working tirelessly to revitalise domestic and foreign investments, which are critical to growing the economy. Capital markets complement policy initiatives and become the transmission mechanisms through which Government can gauge the vitality of its policies.  Prof Ncube said the launch of CFDs has come at an opportune time given the rapidly changing global finance landscape as it has become crucial for investors to have access to innovative instruments that can assist them in managing their risk and seize opportunities in volatile markets.  He said the CFDs’ introduction aligns with the broader vision of positioning Zimbabwe as a regional financial hub and attracting both domestic and international investors. VCG Markets chief executive Mr Abdallah Garib said they were committed to complementing Government saying investments in technology are paving the way for a new era in international collaboration thereby enabling the African markets to tap into the global market and positioning Africa’s ecosystem as the gateway to unlocking the expansion of investments.    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-smallholder-farmers-need-technologies-access-to-spur-production/,Zimbabwe smallholder farmers need technologies access to spur production,"THERE is a need to assist smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe to access technologies that will enable them to increase farm yields, achieve resilience, better nutrition to address poverty and food security as well as economic growth, a Cabinet Minister has said. Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister Dr Anxious Masuka said this at a symposium on Combating Food Insecurity in Southern Africa in the Era of Climate Change Through Mitigation and Adaptation Measures, which his Ministry held jointly with the Bindura University of Science Education in the capital last week. In a speech, which Ministry permanent secretary Professor Obert Jiri read on his behalf, Dr Masuka said there is need for a paradigm shift that enables smallholder farmers in the country, particularly in rural areas, to produce enough to feed themselves and to sell. He said such technologies are simple conventional ones including irrigation, improved seed varieties, use of fertilisers and provision of infrastructure, which have been tested elsewhere.  Dr Masuka said the era when large multinational organisations were considered the only solution to successful agricultural production in the developing world, Southern Africa included, has passed. “The region’s agriculture has continued to under-perform because it is not giving farmers enough yield to feed themselves and get more to take to the market,” he told representatives of government and parastatal officials, academics and educators, researchers, scientists, farmer organisations Non-Governmental organisations, development agencies, business leaders, entrepreneurs, students and young professionals. We are talking about when the rain does not come at the right time or the length of the (growing) season is shortened as a result of drought,” he told the high-level two-day symposium, which ended on Thursday. He added that assisting small-scale farmers to adopt “climate-smart” farming techniques will “prepare them for even more serious challenges in the future”. “An important factor of good land management is the effective and efficient use of water — groundwater, surface water and rainwater,” he said. “When we talk about smallholding farming in Zimbabwe we are talking about a system in which most people depend on rainfall. Therefore, to build a climate-smart system, we need to find a way to preserve the water via rainwater harvesting, among other technologies. What we need to help farmers do is to be able to adopt good land management practices and improve seed stocks, with drought-resistant varieties.” Dr Masuka warned: “Whether we like it or not, climate change is a phenomenon the region is facing. The worst effects of climate change are yet to come, we already have many technologies available to face them and protect our future food supply.” Speaking at the same occasion, Eddie Mwenje, vice-chancellor of the Bindura University of Science Education said a failed season poses a real threat to food security in Zimbabwe.  – New Ziana.logies   "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/utilise-agriculture-extension-officers-to-ensure-food-security/,“Utilise Agriculture extension officers to ensure food security”,"Nqobile Bhebhe in Lupane THE Lupane community has been urged to fully utilise the services of Agriculture extension officers in all agricultural activities in a bid to ensure food security. Speaking in Daluka ward 19 in Lupane East during a Constituency School Business Unit Groundbreaking ceremony, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Professor Ober Jiri
stressed the importance of villagers closely working with extension officers. Prof Jiri said extension officers play a pivotal role in reducing drought impact through advising farmers on best practices in the process ensuring food security. He said all hands should be on deck to migrate the effects of El Nino induce drought countrywide. President Mnangagwa has since declared a nationwide State of Disaster due to the severe drought caused by the El Niño weather phenomenon. “This year we are faced with serious drought. As Government, we said let us monitor weather patterns and ensure what is cultivated should be in line with weather patterns of particular regions. “For this region (Matabeleland North) we encourage small grains and our observations is that farmers and ordinary villagers are implementing that through adhering to extension officer’s advice,” said Prof Jiri. “As Government we applaud the work done by extension officers, it is commendable, ” he added. Prof Jiri said despite the effects of drought many people had prepared for El Nino and President Mnangagwa has declared a state of disaster but stressed that no one will die of hunger. “Food relief will be distributed countrywide through the Social Department. As the ministry, we should plan ahead to prevent falling victim to future droughts.” He emphasised the importance of implementing Intwasa initiative. Prof Jiri also touched on the importance of proper livestock care saying farmers should adhere to dipping regime. “We should reduce livestock deaths. Therefore, due to water shortages, borehole drilling rigs should be deployed in needy areas so that livestock have access to water. “Also, we are against veld fires, that should not happen. Lets preserve the pastures we have. “We are in the process off converting food-stock that has gone bad at all our Grain Marketing Board silos into stock feed.” Speaking at the same event, Chief Mabhikwa said boreholes in the constituency is fast running dry and there is urgent need for deepening of existing boreholes.

She said the access to information about communicable and non-communicable diseases could help eliminate wrong beliefs about some of the diseases afflicting the continent.  Dr Ndlovu made the remarks at the ongoing 5th edition of Africa Women Summit in Nairobi, Kenya. She is among Zimbabwean delegates who include the Minister of State for Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Cde Judith Ncube, and the Permanent Secretary for Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Dr Mavis Sibanda. The Summit is running under the theme: “Women’s Health, Empowering Voices, Inspiring Change”, which end today with a focus on bringing together influential leaders, advocates, experts and stakeholders across the globe to address critical issues surrounding women’s health.  “Empowering women to speak out about their health concerns also can inspire change and help reduce stigma. Empowered women would be less vulnerable to abuse,” said Dr Ndlovu. “We have to create women entrepreneurs who can be independent and think through empowerment tools that can be used to prevent violence against women.  “We must always aspire to change our ways and habits to prevent us from catching communicable and non-communicable diseases for the good of our children and our nations.” The minister said Africa cannot bear the burden of high health expenditures on treatment of various diseases that torment citizens, stressing the need to prevent illnesses. “We must also inspire change in our habits and in the food that we consume, so that we prevent catching various non communicable diseases. We have to continually engage in physical exercises to keep our bodies fit,” she said. Dr Ndlovu said there is a need for there is a strong need to establish a strong rapport in the continent to ensure that the message of women empowerment is heard.  She also urged women not to shy away from discussing sexual health issues with their families or even among themselves. “We must continue to educate them on their rights. The right to say no and the right to say yes. And the reason why they should say no or yes. Knowing their rights is a preventive measure against abuse and getting into unplanned relationships,” said Dr Ndlovu. “It’s, therefore, important to have a rural health care facility in every village ward, which is well stocked with medicines and medical equipment. I would also like to talk about Gender Based Violence. Especially in relation to prevention and support mechanisms. Very often those abused fail to get the necessary support.” She challenged the conference delegates to discuss strategies and mechanisms of counselling those who have been abused and condemned incidents of gender-based violence, calling for more empowerment initiatives as a long term strategy to full emancipation of women.     "

Fueltec is a petrochemical company which focuses on the petroleum industry. The company covers every stage of the fuel supply chain from bulk fuel handling, retail, commercial and individual operators. In an interview, Fueltec sales and marketing manager Mr John Kaitano told the Business Chronicle that since the opening of their Bulawayo branch, they have managed to get many contracts from large established companies to maintain their pumps and other fuel handling machines. He commended their technician covering the southern region for doing a sterling job “Fueltec is growing. The company opened its Bulawayo brunch in 2022 and up to now we have seen growth of about 10 percent,” he said. “We have a new contract with Puma to maintain their pumps across the country and we have staff that will be servicing the region covering Hwange, Kwekwe and Beitbridge. “We are also working with Hwange, Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), and the Beitbridge- Bulawayo Railway (BBR) maintaining of their locos.” Mr Kaitano said plans are underway to install some K200 meters on the locomotives so that they are able to manage the fuel consumption of locos. Meanwhile, the company is embracing new ways of fuel handling Mr Kaitano said they are introducing a fuel dispenser with four pumps and above, which uses a submersible pump. He also said they have introduced TLS, which is a computer system which is used to monitor the movement of fuel from the tanks. “When you receive a new fuel consignment, this TLS, which is a fuel management system will show you new fuel levels and as you issue out, selling to your customers, it will also show you the levels at any given time. “It also gives you some reports depending on what you want to know about your fuel level and it avoids the manual dipping, which promotes efficiency and reduces human error,” he said. “We are also bringing the new product which is called Razm to manage your oils which will avoid oil spilling promoting proper oil handling and disposing of used oils.” @SikhulekelaniM1 "

https://www.chronicle.co.zw/eca-calls-for-human-rights-and-people-centered-approach-to-sustainable-development-in-africa/,ECA calls for human rights and people-centered approach to sustainable development in Africa,"Leonard Ncube, [email protected] The Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has urged for a human-rights and people-centered approach to sustainable development in Africa which is key in ensuring that no one is left behind ECA, established by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1958 as one of the UN’s regional commissions, aims to promote economic and social development among its member states, including Zimbabwe. Its mission includes fostering intraregional integration and enhancing international cooperation for Africa’s development. With 54 Member States, ECA serves as both a regional branch of the UN and a crucial element of Africa’s institutional framework. Speaking at the 57th Session of the Commission on Population and Development in New York City, M Sweta Saxena, Director of the Gender, Poverty, and Social Policy Division at ECA, highlighted that Africa has effectively communicated its priorities by embracing a unified stance on Population and Development in 2022. This approach considers shared interests, differences, and obstacles. “A human rights and people-centric approach to sustainable development in Africa is key to ensuring that no one is left behind and this means that women, young people and vulnerable groups must receive priority attention,” said Ms Saxena. Zimbabwe has already taken the lead in that approach through President Mnangagwa and his Second Republic’s Leaving no-one and no place behind mantra. The meeting was held under the theme: “Assessing the status of implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and its contribution to the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development during the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development”. Ms Saxena highlighted three key issues where regional commitment is vital. She said Africa needs to respond to its population dynamics, which include rapid population growth in countries with some of the most fragile health systems, high rates of poverty, low literacy, high levels of gender inequality and limited access to modern technologies. These dynamics must be accounted for in the design and implementation of  development plans, as well as their implications for Africa’s structural transformation. Secondly, to sustain the successes of the past 30 years, governments need to tackle the inequalities that hurt the poorest and the most marginalized by implementing policies and allocating budgets to ensure the poor and the marginalized benefit from economic growth. Africa also needs to invest in the production of high-quality statistical information and data. In many countries, data systems remain poor – civil registration data are limited and surveys and censuses are not conducted on a regular basis. “A data revolution in Africa would afford our continent to generate its own vibrant data to enable proper planning and better measurement of development outcomes, including the goals and objectives on population and development,” she said. To support Africa’s transformation, ECA in partnership with UNFPA and the African Union has this year carried out a high-quality and evidence-based continental review of the implementation of the AADPD since 2014. Its aim is to influence national policies on population and development. Two decades after the historic Cairo population conference, Africa adopted the Addis Ababa Declaration on Population and Development beyond 2014 which provides region-specific guidance for the full implementation of ICPD in Africa. -@ncubeleon   "

The council is authorized under Sections 48 and 49 of the Model Buildings By-Laws, 1977, as well as Section 214 of the Bulawayo (Buildings, roads and Streets) By-Laws 1971, to address unsafe and unsightly buildings and faulty sewerage systems by charging the property owner for the necessary actions to safeguard public safety. Out of 161 identified buildings in the CBD, 17 have complied, 61 partially complied, four faced legal action, and 79 have made no effort to address structural issues, resulting in penalties being imposed on non-compliant properties. Penalties range from US$500 for buildings without plans and US$250 for building penalties (with plans) and dilapidated buildings The council in its latest report acknowledges that certain buildings in the city center were deteriorating, some abandoned or in a state of disrepair, necessitating action to mitigate risks to the public, though resource constraints have hindered the effective implementation of these measures. Reads part of the report, “Buildings in the city centre were in a poor state and some were considered abandoned, dilapidated or derelict were identified. Council had latitude in terms of statutory provisions to carry out such operations to remove the offending danger/ nuisance to the public at the cost of the landlord. “This avenue had not been effectively pursued in the city in view of lack of specific resources that were required to undertake this costly work that is clearing the sites and effecting demolitions and making good the site.” Chamber Secretary Mrs Sikhangele Zhou highlighted the challenges faced by the council in addressing dilapidated buildings, citing the council’s own struggles with maintenance, particularly with buildings such as  Sidojiwe and Burombo Flats, due to limited resources available for refurbishment efforts “It was a challenge to effect these as Council’s own buildings were also dilapidated.

Minister Ncube and senior Bulawayo City Council (BCC) officials will tour the Eastern European country from May 24 to June 1 under the Black Horse Alley LLC Trade and Commerce umbrella. Since the advent of the Second Republic, Zimbabwe and Belarus have strengthened their co-operation, focusing on economic diplomacy and exchanges in key sectors for economic growth and transformation. The two countries are enhancing collaboration in areas such as mining, infrastructure development and science and innovation. Trade between Belarus and Zimbabwe has grown significantly since 2018, with both nations working on long-term investment projects in agriculture, light industry, mining, healthcare and industrial co-operation. The Belarus Mechanisation Facility has completed two phases, delivering over 2,000 units of various Belarusian agricultural machinery.  With close national bonds, Bulawayo aims to leverage these ties to explore potential areas of co-operation with Belarus According to the latest council minutes, Minister Ncube wrote to the local authority notifying them about the invitation. “My office, the Office of the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Bulawayo Metropolitan Province has been invited to visit the Republic of Belarus under the Black Horse Alley LLC Trade and Commerce umbrella, from the 24th of May to 1 of June 2024. It is against this background that I hereby invite the Town Clerk and Director of Health Services to be part of the delegation that will represent Bulawayo Province on this official visit to the Republic of Belarus. All travelling costs will be borne by the participants,” wrote Minister Ncube. Bulawayo City Council (BCC) The main purpose of the visit is to explore areas of possible co-operation through formal meetings with the National Agency of Investment and Privatisation of the Republic of Belarus and a wide sector of industries for commercial Trade and Joint implementation opportunities. Added to that, site visits and inspections with enterprises in the fields of pharmaceutical medicines, animal health products, agricultural mechanisation equipment and technologies are lined up. Town Clerk, Mr Christopher Dube told councillors that it is critical for the council to have representation as the platform was a valuable opportunity that would economically benefit the city and would help solidify the trade relationship with Belarus through promoting the importation and distribution of Belarusian products in Bulawayo. The council resolved to have Mr Dube and the Director of Health Services, Dr Edwin Sibanda Mzingwane, as representatives of the city. Late last year, Minister Ncube led a city business delegation to the 26th Arab-African Investment and International Co-operation Conference in Egypt to attract international investors to the city. The transformation of Bulawayo’s economy is crucial for the overall development of Zimbabwe as outlined in the National Development Strategy 1 (2021-2025), which aims to progress towards achieving an upper middle-income economy by 2030. The Bulawayo Metropolitan Provincial Economic Development Plan (PEDP) is based on the national development blueprint and aims to leverage key comparative advantages that position the city for significant investment opportunities, particularly in manufacturing-related sectors. Formerly a thriving industrial hub of Zimbabwe with robust infrastructure in industries like textile, leather, meat processing, pharmaceuticals and cement products, among others, Bulawayo is now focused on reviving its past prosperity.

Special Advisor to the President Responsible for Monitoring and Implementation of Government Programmes, Dr Joram Gumbo, who was in Bulawayo yesterday on a tour of General Beltings (GB) Holdings Limited, one of the giant city companies, said the Government through the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has crafted strategies targeted at the revival of ailing industries.  GB Holdings gained prominence for the production of conveyor belts during the pre and post-independence period.  “Its operations were, however, affected by the closure of industries because of various reasons, including the sanctions induced economic hardships,” said Dr Gumbo. The conveyor belt manufacturing company requires at least US$22 million capitalisation funding to modernise its plants and hopes to secure a loan from the Matabeleland Industries Retooling Facility.  Dr Gumbo said some of the measures to support local industries include the promulgation of Statutory Instrument 126 of 2014, which prohibits the importation of locally available rubber products under the Open General Import Licence, the setting up of a Distressed Industries Marginalised Areas Fund (Dimaf) and the Matabeleland Industries Retooling Loan Facility to financially assist distressed companies. He said the purpose of his engagement with industry captains is to expedite project implementation for the accelerated attainment of Vision 2030. “I have had the honour to monitor some development projects covering different sectors, especially those focused on the resuscitation of industries in this previously renowned industrial hub,” said Dr Gumpo. “Government is looking to have a private sector led economy, which will lay the foundation for the achievement of Vision 2030.  “I would like to assure you that the Government will continue to provide an environment that is conducive for private sector led businesses to flourish,” Dr Gumbo said. He said the global industry trends and patterns show that innovation and modernisation are critical if companies are to remain competitive. “I am informed that GB Holdings requires funding to the tune of US$22million in order to modernize its plants among other endeavours,” said Dr Gumbo.  “It is our expectation that the application will be successful and thereby pave way for a serious implementation of the retooling programme.” He said Government’s intention to strengthen the approach to industry operations would ensure that local entities do not lose market share, which might result in closure of business. “My visit comes at a time when there is a profound decrease in manufacturing in the local market share for GB Holdings. I have been briefed that GB Holdings has been confronted with numerous challenges despite the establishment, resuscitation and expansion of mines across the country, which would ordinarily require belts,” said the minister.  “The challenges include stiff competition from cheap imports and limited access to foreign currency to import raw materials.” He said controlling cheap imports was critical to protect local firms and job retention while growing the economy.  “We, therefore, need to find sustainable strategies and initiatives of supporting our own local industries,” said Dr Gumbo. “Indeed, only Zimbabweans can unlock growth, unleash potential and employment opportunities for our population.” GB Holdings acting group managing director, Mr Joseph Gunda, said despite playing a key role in the economy, the company was facing a number of challenges that are crippling operations, such as smuggling and importation of cheap conveyor belts. “The company is a key player in reviving the economy. We manufacture original products that we export to other countries. We are competitive against South African bonafide companies,” he said.  “Our plea is to have the Government assist in capacitating the company, which is able to save forex and promote local products.”       "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/legislator-proposes-jail-sentences-for-exchange-control-violators/,Legislator proposes jail sentences for exchange control violators,"Nqobile Bhebhe, [email protected] ZAKA South legislator, Dr Clemence Chiduwa, has proposed imposing jail sentences on repeat exchange control violators, labelling them as economic saboteurs, in addition to the suggested 200 000 ZiG penalty. Dr Chiduwa made the proposal while contributing to the amendment of the Exchange Control Act Notice 2024, a motion introduced by Deputy Minister of Finance, Economic Development,and Investment Promotion, David Mnangagwa. The motion aims to grant the Reserve Bank the authority to issue multiple penalty orders.  Furthermore, the proposed amendment includes the removal of a provision in the Schedule that previously permitted sellers of goods and services to sell at a 10 percent margin above the exchange rate. It also states that sellers will be deemed to commit a civil offence if they offer goods and services at prices exceeding the exchange rate published by the Reserve Bank. Deputy Minister Mnangagwa said the amendment seeks to, among other issues, have a fixed penalty of ZiG200 thousand for offenders in the Schedule. The penalty is meant to be a deterrent to those businesses that offer goods and services above the stipulated and market-determined exchange rate. “This 10 percent margin, while was fit for purpose before the Monetary Policy, is no longer fit for purpose,” Dep Minister Mnangagwa said.  The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) recently introduced ZiG to be used alongside other currencies as part of comprehensive monetary policy measures aimed at addressing exchange rate fluctuations, reducing inflation and restoring macro-economic stability in the country. Zimbabwe’s new currency is now supported by a mix of precious commodities, primarily gold and foreign currency reserves, with a total value of around US$285 million. While many economic players, such as manufacturers, retailers, key suppliers and other stakeholders have embraced the new currency for transactions, some resistance persists in specific sectors of the economy. Certain service providers, collaborating with speculative illegal money traders, are setting the ZiG exchange rate as high as 1:20 against the US dollar. The official rate is 13,5 to the US dollar. In his contribution, Dr Chiduwa said while a 200 000 ZiG penalty would be appropriate for offending individuals and institutions, a jail term would be much more deterrent. “I am proposing a jail term for repeat offenders. A jail term is very critical for those who are engaged in economic sabotage and those who are harming national interests. I think this is very critical. At this point, in the economic history of this country, we cannot afford to fail with regards to the ZiG,” he added. ZiG notes Dr Chiduwa noted that the operations of the black market, the parallel market rate is a cancer that is affecting the economic fabric of this country. “The parallel market rate is fighting the core values that define who we are in terms of where we want to be as a country. If you look at Vision 2030, it has about six pillars and I want to speak specifically on the pillar on macro-economic stability and financial re-engagement. Under the NDS1, there is a priority area on economic growth and stability. “If you look at NDS1, the Vision 2030, they are giving prominence to economic stability and financial re-engagement. All these will come to note when the core values of our economic fundamentals are being undermined by parallel market activities. “What we need to define from now on, going forward is, anyone who is fighting the vision of Zimbabwe is an economic saboteur. We need to clearly define that parallel market activities are economic crimes. These are economic crimes that are fighting literally everyone.”      "

In a statement, the GMB said to date, payments for wheat amounting to USD 23.7 million have been made. “The clearance of outstanding payments is a serious priority and GMB appreciates the commitment of our farmers in ensuring national food self-sufficiency. “GMB assures of its commitment to continue playing a key role in the agriculture transformation agenda,” it said. Last month, the GMB cleared an outstanding USD 2.8 million for maize and traditional grains that farmers delivered for the 2022/23 summer cropping season. In the past, farmers used to shun the GMB and would sell to private buyers because of inordinate delays in payment. -New Ziana "
