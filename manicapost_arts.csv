Entertainment Correspondent FOR someone who started off as a young preacher, ministering to youths during Scripture Union – releasing a soulful seven-track gospel album after becoming a professional musician is quite a feat for Reverend Mathias Ngove. Reverend Ngove, a clergy with Divine Tribe International Ministries, has taken his dream of transforming lives through the gospel by releasing a seven-track album titled, Jesus My Everything. The project features tracks like Mhere-mhere, which is an advice to youths to shun drugs and substance abuse, given its detrimental impact on their health and future. The title track, Jesus My Everything is a call for people to seek the Lord, lean on Him in season and out of season. Another track, Makatipa Zvipo is an appreciation to Christ for blessing mankind with children and various gifts upon birth. The other track, My Bible and I, encourages young people to read the Word of God so that they live for Christ, while Torai Moyo Wangu is a hymnal song that encourages people to trust God for a bright future. Reverend Ngove will tomorrow launch the album at Courtauld Theatre, where Mutare’s top gospel artistes like Dorcas Moyo, Blessing Shumba, Carol Chidzikwe, Vimbai Dimba, Petty Mukanganwa, Cloris Muchuwaire, Billy Ngoreta, Ellen Anderson, Nyasha Chiripashi and Blessed Musendo are billed to perform. Born in Chivhu, Reverend Ngove went to St Paul’s Kuimba Primary School before proceeding to Norton where he did his secondary education at Vimbai High School. He discovered his artistic gift when he became part of playwrights at school. “The issue of drug and substance abuse is worrisome. Our youths’ future has been destroyed. I wrote the song with deep concern, and believe it will play a critical role in the fight against the scourge,” he said, before adding: “I grew well spiritually and discovered that I had a gift of ministering to young people. I joined Scripture Union as a volunteer and was able to reach out to young people. My music career developed as I realised ministering to young people involved singing. By the grace of God, a door was opened for me to go to Northern Ireland where I was involved in ministering to students. “My musical career shot when I met an Irish lady called Gillian who introduced me to a guitar and taught me how to play. And by the same grace, someone bought me a guitar right there and I carried it back to my country. “I am glad that I still have it. Having trained as a pastor, music was part of my ministering for many years before I thought of going into the studio. “I thank God that in 2023, I was able to produce an album, Mwari Haashanduke, which was well received,” he said. Reverend Ngove is backed by the Generations in Worship (GIWO).   "

Entertainment Correspondent NATIONAL Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) will launch the 2024 edition of the National Culture Month commemorations at Chisumbanje in Chipinge District at the end of this month. The event which is meant to preserve and celebrate the country’s diverse cultural identity will be held in Chief Garahwa’s area under the theme: “Our Culture, Building Zimbabwe Brick by Brick”. Vice President Kembo Mohadi will be the guest of honour at the event expected to draw hundreds of people, among them arts and cultural groups from Manicaland and beyond.
It is also expected to attract several traditional leaders as well as dignitaries from across the country. NAC Manicaland provincial manager, Carol Makoni said preparations for the national event are progressing well. She said the province is excited to host the prestigious cultural event. “Preparations are underway and we are happy with the progress so far. It will be a huge and potentially-intriguing event which will attract a lot of stakeholders as well as visual and performing artistes. Manicaland will take the opportunity to showcase local traditional dances, crafts and traditional foods, among other cultural artefacts. The itinerary will be packed and we are expecting thousands of people to grace the event,” she said. Culture Month commemorations are an extension of World Day of Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, which is celebrated on May 21 – which was set aside by UNESCO in the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity in 2001. This is a huge boost for art and cultural groups in Manicaland as they are set to showcase the province’s rich cultural brand. One of the most successful arts groups in Manicaland – Manicaland Attached Instruments and Dance Exploration (M.A.I.D.E) is excited to have the national event on their home turf. The group was recently awarded a US$33 000 grant for an arts research project. The project — CreativeACTIONs 2 (2023-25) — is the brainchild of Culture Fund of Zimbabwe Trust, in collaboration with European Union. M.A.I.D.E comprises Charlton Torindo, Joseph Sithole and Kudzai Gwaze. More than 100 arts and cultural groups from across Manicaland Province as well as across the country are set to fully explore traditional dances and instruments that originated in Manicaland. Every district in Manicaland has its own eccentric dances such as Zhana (Makoni), Jaka (Buhera), Muchongoyo, Mhongo, Chokoto (Chipinge), Mangoni (Mutasa), Njekunje (Nyanga) and Chidzimba/Chimaisiri (Mutare) and these are expected to be showcased at the launch. “We are excited that the national launch will take place in Manicaland Province. This is a milestone and we are working hard to ensure that we fully utilise the historic opportunity. We are a province which is culturally rich with a lot of supremely talented visual and performing artistes. We are looking forward to dishing what Manicaland has to offer as well as to learn from other cultures from various provinces from across the country,” said a member of the group, Joseph Sithole. Last year’s launch was held in Binga, in Matebeleland North Province. President Mnangagwa officiated at the event which was held under the theme: “Promoting Cultural Diversity, Unity and Peace”.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/blabbermouth-all-that-glitters-isnt-gold/,BLABBERMOUTH: All that glitters isn’t gold,"The ManicaPost   THE greatest tragedy of our generation is that we have people who spend a lot, but have never worked anywhere. One wonders where they would have amassed so much wealth.   Even their age does not correspond with the amount of wealth in their possession. Blabber is not jealous of those who are blessed to the extent of making so much money in a short space of time, but Yours Truly is only worried about our dear young ones, who then try to imitate those big spenders and end up dipping their fingers in cash boxes that do not belong to them. This is the story of a young girl who used to live a lavish lifestyle.   Many are familiar with her in our beautiful city because of her spending spree. Her name is reminiscent of that other deceased princess from the Queen’s land. Yes, I mean the globally acclaimed princess who died some decades ago in that horrific car crash. While the deceased princess was known more because of her philanthropic work, our wayward princess was known for patronising different up-market watering holes where she purchased expensive bottles. She was known for having fun throughout the week, and would create a carnival atmosphere wherever she was — whatever time — all because of her perceived fat wallet. Gentle reader, she was a party animal! What we did not know all along was that she was busy stealing from her employer to fund her insatiable appetite for expensive items. This only came to light recently when she fled the country after her employer audited the cash flows in the company. It emerged that the fuel retail company was fleeced of a substantial amount of money that was diverted to her personal use over a period of time. As Yours Truly pens this piece, our uncultured princess is on the police wanted list. The fugitive is believed to have fled to that other country located in the northern direction of our beloved teapot shaped nation. Those who confided in Blabber said she is now staying with a relative in that country. Blabber really wants our young ones to understand that money is earned, and never admire some of these big spenders in our midst when you do not know the source of their flouted wealth. Far from the madness of this unguided princess of ours, word reading Yours Truly is that there are more players in blood money acts that drove this other local businessman into kidnapping and murdering innocent people. I mean, this other businessman we blabbered about in our previous instalment who operates a few kombis and two grinding mills in that outlying high density suburb named after its prior traditional leadership. Blabber is informed that he is not the only one in the game. Blabber was promised details about this other prominent businessperson who is also unleashing a reign of terror in almost the same area. He is also into some sort of politics. Oh, by the way, Blabber was surprised to learn that some folks believe that this other boy who fell from riches to rags was only dramatising everything. They say he still has his things intact, and was just a content creator, seeking attention. For reasons best known to them, he will soon get back to his luxurious lifestyle after seeing who really cares for him and does not. Much as Blabber does not believe this line of thinking, only time will tell. We can only wait and see! Watch the space!   "

Entertainment Correspondent “HAVING noticed a lot of abandoned used tyres and car parts littering the streets, and being someone who cares for the environment, I decided to recycle the trash into useful items. “I collect worn out tyres, rims, shocks and springs, among other scraps and use them to make furniture, garden décor and novel versions of braais. Even though my core aspiration was to promote the value of recycling, lack of public education about recycling was a setback. I learnt bead work to make fashion bags and novelties, while exploring the manufacturing of cleaning products and signature essences for women and men to make up for any shortfalls in my enterprise. My bead work has become largely recognised to be of a high craftsmanship standard.” This is an inspirational tale of Beauty Dorothy Hughes, who carves beautiful artefacts through recycling ‘end of life’ worn out wares such as tyres and scrap metal. In scrap metal, she recycles worn out tractor disks, car rims and checker plates, among other things. She has also made tremendous strides in making an environmental and economic impact through responsible green business practices, while focusing on using state-of-the-art technology to increase efficiency, quality and reduce costs for end users. She believes that all output from the recycling process should be used in high-value applications— not incinerated. She dreams to open a recycling plant in Manicaland by 2030. “I am inspired to bring worn out wares back into the world. Recycling and re-purposing is in my blood. I am also into designing novelty beaded accessories from recycled plastic. Industry and manufacturers often produce more rubbish than I can actually repurpose to clean up the ever increasing environmental problems effectively. Some people are burning tyres, polluting the environment, while some are cutting down trees, harming the climate,” she said. Hughes, who owns an entity, Dollar Deals Manufacturers, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) Manicaland, in a development which will see her equipping inmates with skills and knowledge in the art, craft and design and be able to produce various artefacts. She aims to continuously innovate and apply environment friendly technologies for conversion of waste into value-added products with the aim to maximise stakeholder value. The development will play a critical role towards self- sustenance of the inmates.   She has already started the ball rolling to impart the skills.   She revealed in an interview recently that she is excited to work with the inmates. “I am happy that the organisation is growing in leaps and bounds and the partnership with ZPCS Manicaland will play a critical role in empowering the inmates. “The inmates’ passion and zeal to learn is unbelievable. It motivates me to work with them as this will help them to sustain them after serving their sentences,” she said.   Officer Commanding ZPCS in Manicaland, Commissioner Spetosomusa Chinobva, said such partnerships with stakeholders will go a long way in rehabilitating inmates.   "

Entertainment Correspondent IT was for the first time in years for masters of different music genres to share the stage before hundreds of dancing and merry-making revellers for the whole day in Mutare. The venue was Chancellor Primary School where more than 10 artistes performed at award-winning gospel musician, Dorcas Moyo’s album launch last Saturday.   The historic launch started off on a low key note around midday, but went a gear up as hundreds of people trickled later during the day. The crowd which consisted of all ages groups enjoyed every bit of the stage performances. The appearance of sungura ace, Alick Macheso further lit up the event as he had a tight schedule after performing in Murombedzi the previous night. He was billed to perform at Aquatic Complex in Chitungwiza that Saturday evening before travelling to Rusitu in Chimanimani the following day, a tight schedule that made many doubt his appearance at the event. Macheso mesmerised many with his heart-pounding bass guitar, especially on the song, Mhanza Haisekwi, a song he co-carved with Dorcas Moyo before he later posted on his Facebook page: “We had a great time in Mutare as I shared the stage with Dorcas Moyo. It was a show to remember and we will forever cherish the night.” Dendera king, Sulumani Chimbetu did not disappoint either and put the icing on the cake with a sterling performance. The crowd was also captivated by popular Kenya-based gospel musician, Fenny Kerubo, whose stage choreography was top notch. Other artistes who performed such as Carol Chidzikwe, Tinashe Murigo, Joyful Praise Choir, Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave, Mathias Mhere, Sabastian Magacha and Blessing Shumba put up top drawer performances. Zim dancehall artiste, Seh Calaz pulled up a surprise, and took the crowd into delirium after he appeared on stage to congratulate Moyo for a successful album launch. He was not part of the line-up, but he had a show elsewhere in Mutare, and made a surprise appearance. Moyo, who was elegantly dressed launched the album, Mvere Dzabvepi, in style as she performed live some of the new songs. The project carries 10 tracks that include Ngaasimudzwe Jesu, Mvere Dzabvepi, Umungwarire, featuring Sulumani Chimbetu, Muroyi Ngaafe, Africa Munoida, Segondo, featuring South-African based diva, Winnie Mashaba, Zvotoparadzana, Kumagumo, Huya Undinyaradze and Ndoimba Sei. It was engineered and produced by Olin Anderson at Kunashe Studios. The album is a cocktail of storyline. While righteousness is its fulcrum, there are lots of scintillating lines enshrined in each and every song — hypocrisy, drug abuse, and faith in God — to sum up the masterpiece. Dorcas Moyo described the event as a huge success which exceeded her expectations. “We had 99.9 percent of the lined up artistes taking up to the stage to showcase their talents. “We managed to go through and tick all the elements of the programme. Our expectations were met and we are happy about that. “The number of revellers could have been more since we were also very generous giving away complementary tickets to the general populace. “I would like to express my profound gratitude to the people of Mutare and beyond. We had people from Kariba, Bulawayo, Gweru, Harare and other places coming down. The people of Manicaland are amazing. “The confidence they showed us was just unbelievable. I want to implore my brothers and sisters that we should stick together forever,” she said.   "

Entertainment Correspondent POPULAR wheel spinner, content creator and videographer, Nyasha Tigere (35), popularly known as DJ Touch has been missing since February 12. Police and his family have launched a search for the talented disc-spinner after he last communicated on February 12. Nyasha’s mother, Spiwe Tigere said her son’s phone is not reachable.   She said they tried to contact his friends, fellow DJs and artistes to no avail. “A few days prior to his missing, we travelled to Rusape for a relative’s funeral. I called him to join us at the funeral and he promised to do so. We expected him to be at the funeral, but he later told me that he could not attend as he was busy in a recording session with a musician. I called him the following day, but he did not respond. He later texted saying he was busy in the studio and he would return my call later. “We did not panic as he would sometimes spend a day or two without coming home doing some recording sessions. We trusted that everything was fine. After spending three days without coming home in Dangamvura, we started panicking. We tried calling him, but his phone was not reachable. We made a police report in March. “We even visited Victoria Chitepo Provincial Hospital as well as their mortuary among other places in search for him. We decided to turn to the social media. “We checked with his friends, fellow DJs and musicians to no avail. We now pin our hope in God as we pray that we will see him again. We are extremely worried,” she said. Nyasha is 1.78 metres tall and weighs 87kg. He is dark in complexion. Tigere reported the matter at Mutare Central Police Station, under reference number IR 471/24. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka appealed to members of the public with information pertaining the whereabouts of the videographer to contact their nearest police station.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/blabbermouth-he-made-it-rain-now-its-raining-on-him/,"BLABBERMOUTH: He made it rain, now it’s raining on him","The ManicaPost   THERE is a catchphrase: “I make it rain.”   It is a line taken from a track by American rapper, Fat Joe, featuring R. Kelly, T.I, Lil Wayne, Baby, Rick Ross and Ace Mac. This is the same line usually hurled by our brothers who would have turned into overnight millionaires as they throw money into the air in public spaces, and let the poor, in our numbers, scramble for cash on the ground. And this dear “King” of ours is one of them who used to “make it rain” when things were flowing for him. Indeed, he made money and lived a lavish lifestyle, occupying rented upmarket houses, known for their swimming pools and 50-acre lawn yards. But somehow things turned upside down, and our dear brother is now back at his mother’s house in that other overcrowded high-density suburb, where most of the residents hailed from — the city’s oldest high-density suburb.   Gentle reader, the boy is now in a sorry state! He is begging for a lift into town to the extent of seating “paKadoma.” Touts and vendors are taking turns to buy him US$1 lunch in town and these have become his friends, while those he used to roll with in the fast lane have suddenly disappeared. Blabber is also reliably informed that whatever is happening to this bozo is a direct result of supernatural money spinning charms that he possessed. Such is the uncontrolled love for money in our midst. No wonder why they say, blood may be thicker than water, but money flows deeper than both! Oh by the way, what is this that we hear about this other local businessman who is continuing with his human blood rituals for the sake of, not only making money, but also to feed his goblins. Yes, this other well-known filthy businessman who operates a small fleet of minibuses as well as two grinding mills on the outskirts of our beautiful city. Residents in that other suburb located about 20 kilometres away from the central business district, on our way to the country’s oldest city, are now scared of randomly walking at night for fear of being kidnapped. He is allegedly kidnapping people for his rituals. Ladies and gentlemen, we actually have people in our midst who allegedly lost their parents after being kidnapped and murdered by this goon, and somehow he has a way of concealing his shenanigans. Recently, there is this lady who cheated death by a whisker after almost being kidnapped by the businessman’s mercenaries. Those with ears have heard!   "

Entertainment Correspondent THE wait is finally over! The much-hyped carnival where multi award-winning gospel musician, Dorcas Moyo will be officially launching her new album is on tomorrow (Saturday). The event will be held at Chancellor Junior School, and stands as one of the biggest merriments in Manicaland so far this year, with more than 20 artistes, including Zimbabwe’s biggest names in the music industry, performing live. The album titled Mvere Dzabvepi carries 11 tracks, among them the title track, Mvere Dzabvepi, Ngaasimudzwe Jesu, Umungwarire, Muroyi Ngaafe, Ndoimba Sei and Segondo. It will feature various artistes and personalities such as Batsirai Shasha and Shugeta. The launch will be exceptional in many ways, chief among them, the expected presence of gospel musicians, Fenny Kerubo and Rose Muhando from Kenya and Tanzania, respectively. This will be Moyo’s first album launch that features the East Africa greats.    Fenny Kerubo The two divas are expected to add a unique and exciting feel to the launch.

Moyo last released the Mhanza Haisekwe album in 2023, which saw her being voted the best female artiste on Radio Zimbabwe. She also scooped a prestigious gong at last year’s NAMA awards – emerging as the outstanding female musician. Moyo, who has spent most of her time, especially during the last two months rehearsing for the big event, is looking forward to a memorable event. She believes her lyrical wizardry and poetic affluence will make the forthcoming album a stand out.    Mathias Mhere Moyo said they will have a roadshow and a cavalcade as she and other artistes drive to the venue. The event starts at 11am till late. “The preparations have gathered momentum. It is not a secret that this is probably one of the biggest musical events to happen in Mutare.

Given that the church he belongs to is an international organisation as suggested by its name, we all thought they are bent on harvesting lost and troubled souls and bring them to the holy presence of the Almighty. Alas, word reaching Yours Truly is that the pastor who leads this denomination is on a money spinning spree, and congregants are opting out of the church in droves.   They are running away in numbers because of his insatiable love for money! Blabber was made aware of how he makes congregants write their pledges on pieces of paper, including timeframes when their pledges should be paid. When the time elapses before the congregant honours their pledge, our dear ‘Man of God’ makes a follow-up in a typical debt collector style. Even tenants and children of his congregants now know him for notoriously waiting until midnight for the congregants to pitch up at home and honour their pledges to him. His name has connotations of Malawian origin. He is not the only ‘Man of God’ doing what is least expected of him. Blabber recently gave a teaser on this other pastor who is now known for his weakness for sweetness. I mean that other pastor who was recently moved from his parish to another within the same church after several complaints were raised about his conduct. The clergy, whose name has something to do with a certain form of gasoline, is employed by that other church whose apostolic mission is predicated on firm faith. Word reaching Blabber is that the youthful clergy has been on the overdrive in his skirt chasing vocation to the extent that certain well-known women in the church actually fought over him in that other high density suburb whose name relates to its yesteryear traditional leadership. Blabber has the names of women who exchanged blows over him as well as the identities of some married women whom he pounced on during his tenure at that parish near a ghetto bus stop, whose name has something to do with a hill. Blabber will soon name and shame them! By the way, before Yours Truly signs off, let it be known that Blabber is aware that a good number of law enforcers recently left their jobs after completing their required duration of service. What Blabber does not know and is busy investigating, is whether most of them made hay while the sun was shining. Blabber will surely revert with detailed lifestyles of some of them, especially those we knew for their uncultured behaviour while they were still on duty.

Entertainment Correspondent IN a new and refreshing development, Manicaland which has been lagging behind in the promotion of the jazz genre and its artistes, is set to host the inaugural provincial jazz festival on April 30. It’s a new dawn for jazz music in the province as it will lead the way in the growth of the critical genre that captures the hearts of many in the global spectrum. The Manicaland Jazz Festival, which is the brainchild of National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ), will be held at Micasa Pub in the city, and six artistes are billed to headline the event. In November 2011, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) officially designated April 30 as International Jazz Day in order to highlight jazz and its diplomatic role of uniting people in all corners of the globe. International Jazz Day brings together communities, schools, artists, historians, academics, and jazz enthusiasts all over the world to celebrate and learn about jazz and its roots, future and impact; raise awareness of the need for intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding; and reinforce international cooperation and communication. NACZ Manicaland manager, Carol Makoni said all is set for the inaugural edition of the festival urging jazz music. Artistes billed to perform are Steve Chikotie, Too Open led by Brian Nhanhanga, WaCharie, Sam Mataure and Expressions Band. “We are glad that preparations of the inaugural event are at an advanced stage. All groups billed to perform are ready for the carnival which is celebrated globally. The festival will coincide with the International Jazz Day which is commemorated annually on April 30, and as Manicaland Province, we are proud to be hosting our own provincial event. The day is meant to create awareness on the importance of jazz music. The festival intends to breathe life to the jazz genre which is not very prominent in Manicaland. “Academia and veteran music education teacher, Tendekayi Kuture, who is a retired music lecturer from Africa University, will do a presentation on the history of jazz music and its evolution to the different forms which are being played nowadays,” said Makoni.    Brian Nhanganga Micasa proprietor and co-organiser of the event, Tich Shoniwa said it is all systems go. “It is our pleasure to host the inaugural edition of the festival. Jazz is one of the most sought after genres across the globe and it is a great development to honour the day with some performances.” The lineup is a blend of upcoming and veteran jazz musicians. Brian Nhanhanga, who is now based in Mabvuku where he is also a producer, boasts of more than 30 years in the music industry. He is the leader of Afro-jazz group, Too Open, popularly known for performing own compositions as well as cover songs. One of the major highlights of his career was when he played with Ragga Manyika outfit, Assegai Crew, from 1994 to 1996, and recorded the hit album, Zvese Mari, which contains the plug track, Mai Bhoyi. Born in Mutare’s oldest ghetto of Sakubva’s New Chisamba section, Nhanhanga became popular after releasing the chartbuster, Matida Hostel, on the album Zororo. He has promised to put up a sterling performance. “I am glad to be part of the line-up. It is a perfect reunion with jazz lovers in Mutare, and we would like to thank the organisers for honouring the genre with such an event,” he said.
Chikotie, who is a tried and tested jazz musician, said the inaugural fest was a long over-due initiative. “This is a milestone to jazz music in Manicaland. This is a genre that deserves more recognition. I promise to put up a memorable performance,” he said   "

Post Correspondent THE year 1992 was a unique dispensation in the country’s entertainment domain. It was the year when one of the finest songs ever to emerge from the Zimbabwean showbiz was coined. The song is irresistible and anthemic in night clubs, at public gatherings, weddings, parties and public transport. The song – dubbed Murambinda – was carved by the late legendary and iconic wordsmith, Paul Mpofu and Zambuko Band. It is sad that death snatched such a unique and creative wordsmith from our midst. He left when people were beginning to appreciate his music and talent.   The song was famous for its well-arranged instruments, neatly-crafted lyrics, excellent chord progression, perfect blending of vocals and instruments. One of the special attributes that make a song good is its ability to evoke a specific emotion of feeling. It was and it is a danceable, yet unique piece of art with a jiti feel. Murambinda is a timeless classic. It is a love song.   It is a stern warning to a jealousy rival suitor who tries to woo a friend’s wife by flashing a glitzy life of, among other things, putting on fancy and expensive clothes whenever he visits his home. In the song, Mpofu advised the rival suitor to desist from such cunning acts, and leave his apple of the eye alone or else it would end in tears. Mpofu chronicled an arduous journey he undertook from the then dusty village of Murambinda in Buhera District of Manicaland, where he ‘scouted’ his newly-found and unpolished diamond and travelled to settle with her in Harare. As the song nears its end, and still in its danceable manner, Mpofu equated the song to ‘honey’. Murambinda, back then was just a small and dusty growth point situated in a communal district of Buhera. Fast forward to 2024, Murambinda is now a town and everything that is obtaining in this settlement now bears testimony to this. Everything happening there is now designed to transform it into a modern, smart and inclusive urban settlement. New buildings are now being approved on the basis of how they help beautify the town and planners are now working on its attractiveness so that it evolves within the parameters of the smart city. Town status is a journey on its own — and now that Murambinda is a town, efforts are being made to make it a technologically driven settlement with efficient transport and energy systems. Granting of town status is done through Section 4(1)(a) of the Urban Councils Act, and Presidential proclamation. Murambinda has a strong footing, given that it is coming from an entirely communal background, with the land being turned into State land and being incorporated into its boundaries. This means land is basically cheaper as the town board will only compensate for improvements and not the land itself.   A population of about 15 000 people are so far settled at Murambinda. On reflection, one wonders what could have inspired Mpofu to come up with Murambinda, of all growth points in the country, as the title of his song. The Manica Post this week tracked down the producer of the song, Bothwell Nyamhondera – a man with 40 years of experience in the music production industry. “It was and still a very popular song. After its release, the song shook the nation. It was like a national anthem. “The guitars were unique and well arranged. He was a unique and very creative artiste. Although Mpofu did not divulge much on what inspired him to come up with the song, he was a creative storyteller who often tackled issues that affected people’s day-to-day lives like love, betrayal, marriage and hate, among other things. Back then love songs would not struggle to penetrate the market and become instant hits. “And Murambinda was just what the doctor had prescribed, and now that the Independence Day celebrations are being held at Murambinda, it will be befitting to have this great and legendary musician honoured for popularising the growth point through such an anthemic song,” said Nyamhondera. The publication also caught up with Paul Mpofu Junior, who has inherited his father’s rich musical heritage. Mpofu Jnr, who is now a drummer at Alick Macheso’s Orchestra Mberikwazvo, said although his daddy is late, his memory is still perched in the legions of his followers. “I was just eight-years-old when he died. I was later told that my father was a storyteller and sometimes his lyrics were inspired by dreams. That song Murambinda is a piece of art and the story never involved my parents. Unlike what most people thought, my mother does not come from Murambinda.
My mum would always say my father was also an avid reader, and he loved reading Shona poems. She also said he would craft a song by merely looking at nature or people at a shopping centre,” said Mpofu Jnr.   "
