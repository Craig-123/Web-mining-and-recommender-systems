                     Zimplats nominates new external auditor
                    ","ZIMPLATS Holdings’ board of directors have nominated Axcentium as the company’s external auditor, effective October 31, 2024, subject to shareholder approval. The nomination follows Deloitte Africa (Deloitte)’s announcement of a management buy-out of Deloitte Zimbabwe by its local partners following its decision to exit Zimbabwe. Deloitte’s exit from Zimbabwe will be effective from October 31, 2024. Deloitte Zimbabwe will remain an affiliate of Deloitte Africa until the effective date, after which Deloitte Zimbabwe will trade under the name Axcentium. “Axcentium’s nomination follows a rigorous due diligence process and considers the company’s external audit requirements after October 2024,” Zimplats said in a statement. “The board of directors is satisfied that Axcentium has the qualifications, expertise, competence, independence and historical knowledge of the company to ensure a smooth transition, while delivering external audit services at the required level of expertise.” A resolution proposing the appointment of Axcentium as Zimplats’ external auditor will be put before shareholders at the company’s 2024 annual general meeting. Zimplats spent US$789 million during the quarter to March this year towards major capital projects, including the development of Mupani and Bimha mines upgrade as the platinum group metals miner expands operations. The Bimha and Mupani mine development and upgrade projects will replace production from Rukodzi, Ngwarati and Mupfuti mines. Cumulatively, US$395 million had been spent on these projects as at March 31, 2024, against a total project budget of US$468 million. The firm spent US$340 million on the smelter expansion and SO2 abatement plant against a total project budget of US$521 million. The report noted that US$27 million had been spent on the implementation of the 35 megawatts solar plant project to date, against a budget of US$37 million. The company also expended US$27 million on the execution of the Base Metal Refinery refurbishment project, against a total budget of US$190 million. The projects are part of Zimplats’ US$1,8 billion expansion programme.   "

                     ZiG brought more misery for consumers: CCZ
                    ","THE Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) says the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency has brought more “challenges” for consumers than those they faced prior to its introduction, because people are failing to use the new currency outside the formal retail sector. ZiG was introduced last month to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, but the new currency has faced public resistance, especially from commuter transport operators, making life difficult for consumers. “As the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe, we were delighted when we heard that we are going to have a currency backed by gold reserves being announced by the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe,” CCZ chief executive officer Rosemary Mpofu told NewsDay Business in an interview. “We were very excited because we heard the country had enough gold to back the new Zimbabwe Gold currency. We very much believed that when the currency is backed by gold and other commodities, it would give more value to our currency.” She said they believed that the money would give people more buying power like such other currencies as the South African Rand, Botswana Pula and the United States dollars. “With that being said, as consumers, we are facing several challenges, which has resulted in us failing to easily accept the new currency,” Mpofu said. “These challenges have greatly impacted the acceptance of the new local currency by consumers in the country. It seems the new currency has brought us more challenges than those we faced before the introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold currency.” Mpofu noted that commuter operators were not eager to accept the new currency and were charging the public double the normal price because they cannot provide change. “When boarding public transport on our everyday normal routes, we see that the same route that we used to travel using US$0,50, we are being charged US$1 because of change challenges,” she said. “Sometimes we are forced to buy things that we do not want just for us not to leave our money with public transport operators. The same route that I used to travel using US$1, to and from, the price has doubled.” She also complained about how consumers were failing to buy fuel using the new currency despite the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) announcing fuel prices in ZiG. “Moreover, when it comes to fuel in the country, it was announced recently that consumers are now able to buy fuel in local currency and Zera announced the ZiG prices for fuel. However, we have not seen any fuel station that is accepting ZiG in exchange for fuel. We did a survey and also consulted with Zera and we discovered that so far, no fuel station is accepting ZiG,” she noted. Mpofu also expressed her worry that service providers were rejecting the new currency, while others were still manipulating the exchange rate. “Another challenge is emanating from schools. Several schools are rejecting the payment of fees using the new currency only accepting the US dollar. Where else are we going to use the ZiG currency? “So far, the only place we can use the ZiG currency is in the supermarkets. Why are the service providers rejecting the ZiG currency?” she quizzed. “Another pressing issue is that of the exchange rate. We were told by the central bank that the rate will be at US$1: ZiG13,56 with an allowance of service providers to have a margin of up to ZiG14 according to statutory instrument 118. “However, we are seeing some charging with rates as high as US$1: ZiG21. We need to know what RBZ [Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe] and the FIU [Financial Intelligence Unit] are doing to deal with this.” She urged the authorities to address these pressing issues and restore confidence in the new currency. “So as CCZ, these are some of the challenges that consumers are facing, and on behalf of the consumers, can the authorities look into these issues to bring confidence in this currency?” she queried. “They need to make sure that all businesses comply with the set exchange rate because they are the ones destabilising the new currency. Moreover, the authorities should continue dealing with the black market and should continue to arrest all the culprits. “Without addressing these issues, we are going to miss the target of reaching an upper middle-income economy by 2030,” she added.   "

                     Dairy industry under threat
                    ","RISING costs, which are accounting for 70% of total expenses, are threatening the sustainability of Zimbabwe’s dairy industry, NewsDay Business has learnt. The cost of feed stock largely accounts for total expenses. Zimbabwe Association of Dairy Farmers (ZADF) chief executive officer, Paidamoyo Chadoka said local dairy products were uncompetitive due high production costs, which has resulted in cheap dairy products from neighbouring countries, particularly South Africa, flooding the market. “Zimbabwe lacks competitiveness due to the unsustainably high cost of production compared to regional counterparts,” she said. “Our cost of production is mainly driven by stock feeds costs, labour and cost of power, critical components which are too high when compared to other countries. “The producer price of milk per litre in Zimbabwe averages US$0,60 compared with an average price of US$0,40 per litre in South Africa, US$0,36 in Zambia, US$0,50 in Botswana and a world average of US$0,46 per litre. “The high-cost environment pushes our producer prices to be among the highest in the region. At this price most farmers are struggling to break even. The high costs of feed also compromise our milk yields significantly when compared to other regional players.” She said ZADF has launched a nationwide artificial insemination initiative aimed at improving the nation's dairy cow population and milk production. The programme seeks to elevate milk output to meet the country's increasing demand. The programme is in collaboration with key development partners such as We Effect under an International Monetary Fund project. ZADF says Zimbabwe recorded a 9% surge in milk production to 99,82 million litres in 2023 from 91,39 million litres the previous year. However, the country's annual milk requirement hovers around 120 million litres, and imports are currently bridging the gap. Chadoka highlighted the association's efforts to make semen available at subsidised rates. She emphasised that artificial insemination was an efficient method to boost dairy cattle herds, noting that ZADF was targeting all farmers, including beef producers interested in dairy genetics. “ZADF is working with all dairy farmers and some beef farmers who are willing to take up dairy genetics across the country,"" she said. “ZADF is targeting farmers in the traditional milk producing regions as well as greenfield regions taking up milk production for the first time.” While the prevailing El Niño-induced drought has also severely affected the country’s dairy sector, recent data from the Dairy Services Department, has, however, revealed a 21% increase in  milk production during the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period last year.   "

                     Vumbachikwe Mine faces corporate rescue.
                    ","SOME Vumbachikwe Mine creditors are advocating that the company be placed under corporate rescue, claiming the firm was heading towards insolvency, NewsDay Business can reveal.  Vumbachikwe Mine, situated in Gwanda and owned by Duration Gold, reportedly owes various creditors, including workers, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and Zesa Holdings more than US$10 million. Priscillar Gustavo of Masamvu and DaSilva-Law Chambers, who is representing Fawcett Security Operations, said they have initiated the process of placing Vumbachikwe Mine under corporate rescue. “The application (is) in terms of the Insolvent Act 2018 which replaced the judiciary management and introduced the corporate rescue was served to the company on April 25, that a corporate rescuer be appointed to save the company,” she said. NewsDay Business is in possession of the court application filled at the High Court on April 25. In its founding affidavit, Fawcett said it has provided private security services on contract to Vumbachikwe over the past approximately 10 years. “Since about 2022 the 1st respondent has had challenges paying for the security services rendered by applicant at its Vubachikwe Mine as and when such payments fell due,” the affidavit reads in part. “By a letter dated April 20, 2023 the 1st respondent acknowledgement its indebtedness to the applicant in the sum of US$170 000 being the amount due and owing as at that date in respect of private security services rendered by the applicant for the period from 2022 to 2023 at Vubachikwe Mine.” Vumbachikwe has not been operating since November 2022 after workers downed tools over outstanding salaries and poor working conditions, among other issues. Sources told NewsDay Business that the case would be heard in court tomorrow (Friday). Reached for comment Vumbachikwe Mine spokesperson Robert Mukondiwa said: “I cannot comment on something that I have not seen because that would be speculation. I need to see it and consult our legal team because what you are talking about is a legal document.” Duration also runs Gaika Mine, Athens Mine and Royal Family. "

                     Industry minister engages businesses over ZiG
                    ","INDUSTRY and Commerce minster Mangaliso Ndlovu says he will be establishing very “close communication” channels with industry over the next two weeks to find areas of co-operation. This is a follow-up to a meeting which Ndlovu had with retailers on Monday this week to discuss the impact of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency on their business. According to Ndlovu, manufacturers were increasingly demanding payments in United States dollar. “Government will always support such investments,” the minister said after touring two new National Food Holdings Limited plants yesterday. He toured a US$5,6 million pasta manufacturing plant and a US$7,7 million biscuit making line. “It gives confidence for them to continue investing. And like I say, I’m very excited when it’s a strategic investment that either leads to import substitution or growth of our exports,” he said. “These are areas that we will be supporting quietly strongly. We will be establishing in the next week or two, I think, very close communication channels across industry just to make sure that from a policy perspective we work together with the private sector.” Ndlovu said the ministry would be crafting most of these policies in that framework. “We will make sure that we take on board the valuable views coming from industry,” Ndlovu said. Amid inflationary challenges being faced in the market, made worse by the current drought, industry needs policy consistency to continue operating. However, Ndlovu said government supports investments such as those by National Foods which lead to import substitution and lower demand for foreign currency. National Foods Holdings’ investment into the two new plants is part of a wider US$40 million investment over the past three years to upscale its production levels across the entire business. National Foods Holdings chief executive officer Mike Lashbrook said while drought remained a threat, the firm was confident that it had enough grain to produce up to June 2025. "

                     London firm targets bulk-mining in Zim
                    ","LONDON Stock Exchange-listed metal exploration company Kavango Resources is consolidating bulk-mining to increase Zimbabwe’s gold production, NewsDay Business can report. The company, which has begun work at its Hillside gold project in Matabeleland South province, disclosed that the nation’s bulk-mining potential remained largely underdeveloped as the process requires the open pit mining of a large ore body in order to be economic. “Kavango has consolidated strategically-sized land packages around a number of historic high-grade gold mines in the Matabeleland region of Zimbabwe,” the mining firm said in a statement following release of assay results for its Hillside project. “The company’s objective is to investigate their wider, under-developed bulk-mining potential. Bulk-mining is the large-scale extraction of near-surface gold from vast open-pit mines. Because of the large quantities of ore being processed, bulk mining allows gold to be produced economically from lower-grade material than high-grade underground mining.” Open pit mining has become the dominant style of mining in Western Australia and has been the primary driver behind Australia’s emergence as the world’s leading gold producer in recent decades. The firm believes Zimbabwe’s geology mirrors that of Western Australia as the country has a rich history of high-grade gold mining across its greenstone belts. However, it added that Zimbabwe’s potential to host a multitude of large-scale, bulk minable gold deposits remained largely undeveloped presenting the nation with an immense economic opportunity. Kavango said many of Zimbabwe’s historic high-grade mines and the areas surrounding them were split into small ground claims held by various owners. As the firm is consolidating claims into packages on the scale required for economic bulk mining to take place, it indicated that it was using modern exploration and drilling techniques to assess potential for hosting open pit mines, helping to modernise Zimbabwe’s gold mining industry. “Kavango began an exploration and drilling programme across its three existing projects late last year, starting with its Hillside project. Work began at Hillside, and results so far have exceeded the company’s expectations, providing strong evidence of the project’s open pit mining potential,” it noted. “Last month, Kavango revealed that assays from drilling at Hillside Prospects 2 and 4 had returned wide areas of significant gold at shallow depths.” Kavango’s next steps at Hillside are expected to see the testing of the gold-bearing potential of the shears it has interpreted at Prospects two and three with a series of drill holes. This is expected to enable it to test the potential for a bulk mineable gold deposit across the entire shear zone at both prospects. The company is also awaiting assay results from Hillside Prospects 1 and 4. Drilling is also underway at its Nara project to test a 200-metre wide by five kilometres long strike corridor within the property, which have been interpreted as a potential shear zone. Drilling is also planned at the Leopard project. "

                     WestProp plots mega capital raise
                    ","VICTORIA Falls Stock Exchange-listed WestProp Holdings Limited is in talks with “several parties” as it moves to ensure the success of another capital raise expected in the next three months to accelerate its projects. The discussions come a year after an initial public offering (IPO) raised about a tenth of the amount required after shareholders subscribed to preference shares worth US$3,3 million out of the US$30 million that was on the table. WestProp chief executive officer Ken Sharpe told NewsDay Business that the company was “getting ready” for another capital raise. He said the lesson learnt from last year was that WestProp was supposed to do a book building exercise to whet the market’s appetite about the IPO. The book building exercise, Sharpe said, was a pre-marketing of the capital raise “to make sure that the market has an appetite and the capacity to fund the amount that you need”. “We are in discussions with several parties. We expect an announcement to be made within the next two to three months of a significant transaction on capital raise that will change the trajectory of the company dramatically. We are busy doing those book building exercises now,” he said. Last week, WestProp began the development of the US$300 million mixed-use Hills Luxury Golf Estate as its urban renewal push intensifies. Its other projects include Millennium Heights which is ongoing, Pokugara Residential Estate, Pomona City (ongoing), The Mall of Zimbabwe and Millennium Heights Office Park. WestProp executives were recently on a roadshow in the United States to raise more interest in their projects. For Sharpe, it was a significant moment announcing a development happening in Zimbabwe like the Hills Estate in Washington, the world’s “capital”. “I felt proud that we as Zimbabweans can get things that can be recognised by the international community. “In the capital city of one of the world’s powerhouses and announcing that Zimbabwe was going to be doing something exceptional, something that is a game changer, something that raises the bar, for me was humbling,” he said. “This gave me the confidence that this is not the first roadshow nor the last, but the first of many that we will be doing in the diaspora. Our brothers and sisters out there have access to several billions of United States dollars. That is enough money to rebuild our country.” Sharpe said while international financiers can come on board it would be more exciting when “Zimbabwean brothers and sisters” take money from their pockets and send it home. “As WestProp we are ready to build the country together and we know that with their commitment it would be much faster. We have several people committed to the project from that event and we will continue doing the roadshows.” he said. He, however, bemoaned the absence of mortgage facilities by banks which he said was not normal for any economy. “We are not a bank, but our mortgage book of US$24 million growing to US$30 million is bigger than any bank in Zimbabwe; that is not normal, that is not possible. Why are banks not providing mortgages? “Why are they not accessing international markets for mortgage-backed securities which could be sent to Zimbabwe? Sanctions have gone, but they are not active enough. My message to them is please be more active,” he said. Sharpe said the central bank could lend the statutory reserve to commercial banks at concessionary rates for lending to the real estate and manufacturing sectors, among others, as “we know we are productive”. Recently the central bank increased the statutory reserves to 20% from 15%. “We are not going to put that money into consumption. We are going to put that into permanent infrastructure that develops our country and create value. And, when we do that, the economy grows,” he said. "

                     General Beltings seeks to consolidate market position
                    ","ZIMBABWE Stock Exchange-listed General Beltings (GB) expects to consolidate its market position in the energy and cement manufacturing sectors in response to the impact of geo-political conflicts and El Niño-induced drought. In a statement accompanying financial results for the financial year 2023, GB chairperson Godfrey Nhemachena said Cernol Chemicals was also expected to consolidate its traditional market recovery as new models of hospitality offerings evolve. “The company expects to consolidate its market position in the energy and cement manufacturing sectors in addition to the other non-platinum group minerals as envisaged in the National Development Strategy 1 which is underpinned by the growth in the mining sector,” he said. “Cernol Chemicals is expected to consolidate its efforts in traditional market recovery as new models of hospitality offerings evolve. Existing and new strategic partners being pursued are expected to strengthen market positioning in new market niches.” Nhemachena said the geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East will continue to impact on demand patterns of mineral commodities in the short to medium term as there were no signs of cessation to the conflicts. Due to geopolitical tensions, mineral reserves will flood the markets and depress demand for minerals that Zimbabwe would ordinarily supply. This, according to him, will force local mines to curtail production or mothball operations. “These developments would in turn negatively affect the company’s downstream demand. Despite the depressed demand in the economy, the group saw total volumes at 921 tonnes, 2,5% shy of the prior year’s 944 tonnes due to improved throughput at GB division. “Cernol Chemicals market recovery efforts yielded a lower than expected outcome with volumes marginally lower than the prior year,” Nhemachena said. “Although price competition intensified in the year, total turnover at ZWL$29 billion increased by 99% when compared with prior year’s ZWL$15 billion due to sustained volumes from prior year at General Beltings and a favourable market mix at Cernol Chemicals. “Owing to the USD imported inflation and a deteriorating exchange rate in an increasingly dollarised environment, the gross profit at ZWL$11 billion was 38% higher than the prior year's ZWL$8 billion.” The company benefited from improved internal process efficiencies, which arose from scheduled plant maintenance and refurbishment. Operating costs rose by 150% to ZWL$15 billion in the prior year due to the effects of inflation and dollarised quasi institution costs. Operating profit declined by 150% to sit at ZWL$2 billion on the back of increased dollarisation and inflationary pressure. "

                     Econet says it wants to make all remittances into Zimbabwe free
                    ","Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, the country’s largest telecommunications and technology company, says its decision to make remittances from United Kingdom and South Africa free has been well received and should remain in force “for the foreseeable future”.  Econet’s group chief executive, Douglas Mboweni, said the initiative would remain in place for some time, adding that the company was in fact exploring ways of expanding the free remittance initiative to other routes, such as the United States, Europe and Middle East. “The initiative will continue for the foreseeable future. We are now actually working on expanding the free remittances to Zimbabwe to other source markets, such as the US, Europe and Middle East, so that Zimbabweans with friends and family in those regions can also benefit from our offer,” Mboweni said. “However, our group currently does not have licenses that allow us to extend the service to all markets at this time. But we are busy looking at how we can do that,“ he said. Last week Econet achieved an Africa first by opening free remittance corridors that completely eliminate the cost for remittances from the UK and South Africa into Zimbabwe. This followed the company partnering with its sister company, Sasai Money Transfer, to enable individuals and companies in the United Kingdom and South Africa to send money into Zimbabwe free of charge, with the receiver cashing out of their EcoCash US dollar wallet for free. Dr Mboweni said the market reaction to the initiative had been very positive, adding that he expected many people to start channelling remittances via Ecocash. He said there were virtually no minimum limits to how little one can send at any given time. “If someone from the UK wants to send $5 to someone in Zimbabwe, it’s ok with us. We can handle small or large amounts and it’s done in an instant.” “We believe EcoCash’s extensive network, already in use for domestic USD transfers around the country, and in particular in the rural areas, will be key in providing convenience to people in remote villages and districts to access their funds,” Mboweni said. Last week Mboweni explained that the decision to offer free remittances had been motivated by the desire to help Zimbabweans weather the challenges caused by drought.  The country recently declared a national disaster over a drought caused by the climate event known as El Niño, which has left more than 2.7 million people in need of food aid.  Some analysts and experts have urged the government to take advantage of the intermediation role of Ecocash to allow ZiG cash-in and cash-out, thereby building confidence in the new currency.

The group’s key businesses include reinsurance and reassurance, short term insurance, life and pensions, real estate and wealth management. In a statement accompanying financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, Zimre chairperson Desmond Matete said the group was in a strong financial position with real growth in total assets and excellent cash generation. “Across all key lines of our business, including reinsurance and reassurance, short term insurance, life and pensions, real estate and wealth management, we witnessed exceptional profitability in real terms throughout the year 2023,” he said. The group’s total assets uplifted by 81% to ZWL$1,180 trillion in inflation adjusted terms. The group’s healthy balance sheet position is evidence of its resilience and commitment to provide its stakeholders with security, growth and profitability. The insurance contract revenue experienced a remarkable increase of 140%, reaching ZWL$255 billion. “This strong growth is attributable to the group’s local reinsurance and pensions business operations, which collectively contributed 78% to the total premiums written during the year,” Matete noted. “The premium income growth was primarily driven by the expansion into new markets, the introduction of innovative product offerings and increased new product acceptance by the market.” In addition, the regional reinsurance business operations contributed to the overall insurance contract revenue, with premiums accounting for 17% of the total premium inflows, stemming from new business acquisitions and increased external business support. This was underpinned by improved underwriting capacity following successful balance sheet enhancement strategies. The group demonstrated a strong ability to generate new sales in tough operating environments, with the value of new business increasing to 29% during the year. Insurance service income increased by 321% compared to prior year to ZWL$77,5 billion as a result real growth in topline for all insurance entities and a slower growth of 62% in direct insurance service expenses. The group’s total income for the year was ZWL$357,6 billion, up 96% compared to the prior year. The growth was underpinned by strong real growth in insurance contract revenue in the local and regional reinsurance and life and pensions business segments; positive net investment income returns as well as fair value gains on foreign currency denominated assets. The real estate business also contributed to total income growth exhibiting significant growth in rental income, with a 138% increase in inflation adjusted terms. The group’s local operations recorded increased volumes of foreign currency-denominated income during the year at 84% as business operations shifted significantly from local to foreign currency to preserve value for its stakeholders. “Whilst 2023 was a turbulent year and presented formidable headwinds, the ZHL group is optimistic that like the eagle, it shall soar in 2024,” he said. The group’s strategy remains anchored on delivering a strong cash wallet by driving a cost-effective insurance float through momentum and scale; increasing the contribution from the regional investments; and tilting the property portfolio towards high-yielding commercial and retail sectors through near liquid investment structures. “The group will continue to consolidate on its experience and dynamism to enhance market share acquisition through innovations and new tools that embrace customer centric ecosystems which will create new value and change for its stakeholders,” he said. “This will be buttressed by significant investment in technology platforms that enhance customer interface with our business and an enduring experience engendering long term customer loyalty.” "

                     Govt introduces fresh tax to keep forex inland
                    ","FINANCE minister Mthuli Ncube says government will tax US$0,02 for every US$1 leaving the country to ensure forex availability locally, as the State desperately tries to protect the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency introduced a few weeks ago. For years, the formal financial institutions’ foreign currency supply has been dwindling despite central bank estimating that there was potentially US$2,5 billion unbanked in the economy. In Statutory Instrument (SI) 80 of 2024 published in the Extraordinary Government Gazette dated May 3, 2024, government will retain US$0,02 for every US$1 leaving the country. These changes were made under the Finance Act whereby the Finance Amendment of Sections 22B and 22G Regulations, 2024, introduces changes to the automated financial transactions tax and the intermediated money transfer tax (IMTT). “Section 36G (2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate US$0,02 on every dollar of every outbound foreign payment or part thereof for each transaction on which the tax is payable,” Ncube said in the SI. The move is most likely to affect local industry importing raw materials and foreign headquartered businesses operating locally, who are remitting back to their respective countries. Also, the new measure will affect outbound remittances and those who transact online with businesses not domiciled in Zimbabwe. Such a move will likely add to the already high cost structure of businesses and further pile inflationary pressure on the economy. Ncube also introduced new charges for withdrawing ZiG and on local currency transactions. “It is hereby notified that the Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion minister has, in terms of Section 3 of the Finance Act [Chapter 23:041, made the following regulations: These regulations may be cited as the Finance (Amendment of Sections 22B and 22G) Regulations, 2024 Amendment of Section 22B,” he said. “Section 22B (‘Automated Financial Transactions Tax’) is amended by the repeal of Section 22B(a) and substitution with the following: For each withdrawal above the local currency equivalent of US$100, a regional currency equivalent of US$0,05.” will be charged. Regarding the IMTT, this will be calculated at a rate of 0,02 on every ZiG transaction or part thereof transacted for each transaction on which the tax is payable. “Provided that if a single transaction on which the tax is payable is equivalent to or exceeds the equivalent in Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] of US$500 000 (at the prevailing interbank rate) a flat intermediated money transfer tax of the equivalent in Zimbabwe Gold [ZiG] of US$10 150 (at the prevailing interbank rate) shall be chargeable on such transaction,” Ncube continued. The SI stated that Section 36G(2) of the Taxes Act shall be calculated at the rate of 0,02 on every US dollar or part thereof for each transaction on which the tax is payable. “Provided that if a single transaction on which the tax is payable is equivalent to or exceeds US$500 000 a flat intermediated money transfer tax of US$10 150 shall be chargeable on such transaction,” Ncube added. A charge of 0,02 was also levied on every Zimbabwe-gold-backed digital token or part thereof transacted for each transaction on which the tax is payable. "

                    ","FIDELITY Life Assurance Zimbabwe registered a huge jump of nearly 1 000% in profit after tax to ZWL$101,13 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, buoyed by huge increases in revenues. In the comparative period, the company registered a profit after tax of slightly over ZWL$1 billion. In its latest financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, Fidelity chairman Livingstone Gwata said the group’s insurance contract revenue stood at ZWL$116,6 billion at the end of the period under review, up 242% from 2022. “Inflation adjusted insurance contract revenue recorded a strong growth of 242% compared to the previous year from ZWL$34,1 billion to ZWL$116,6 billion. Historical cost insurance contract revenue grew by 962% compared to prior year from ZWL$4,6 billion to ZWL$48,5 billion,” he said. “The impressive growth in insurance contract revenue was on the back of the group’s innovative product development bearing fruits and increased uptake of the company’s products offering on the market.” The group recorded significant growth in premium inflows through its Vaka Yako product contributing 83% of the individual life premiums. The Zimbabwe operation contributed 62% of the premium inflows, while 38% is attributable to the Malawi operation. The group’s insurance service result increased by 280%, underpinned by the real growth in insurance contract revenue. “This is despite an increase in insurance service expenses propelled by the increase in claims and directly attributable costs due to the inflationary environment prevailing in Zimbabwe and the regional business operation,” Gwata said. Insurance service expenses were recorded at ZWL$34,14 billion at the end of the period under review, from a 2022 comparative ZWL$12,09 billion. The increase in revenue also included a 91% growth in net investment income to nearly ZWL$71 billion, from the 2022 comparative. This was driven by fair value gains from investment property, equities and interest income from money market investments. However, the net change in investment contract liabilities stood at ZWL$81,29 billion during the period, from ZWL$4,86 billion in 2022. “The business remains on high alert to these activities and will continue to monitor and carefully adapt to these changing circumstances to deliver value to its key stakeholders,” Gwata noted. “The business will be preserving its cash wallet through responsible spending and targeted investment into products that survive the test of time. Innovation will be key in also driving the products that create and preserve shareholder and policyholder value.” He said Fidelity’s goal was to leverage on building and delivering sustainable insurance products and services to clients and stakeholders. In terms of assets, these were valued at ZWL$483,77 billion, up nearly 79% from the 2022 comparative, driven by investment properties. Gwata, however, noted that the group needed to strengthen its capital position. "

                     The Top 5 Container Shipping Companies In The World
                    ","Container shipping is at the core of the global economy, with this industry ensuring that goods can flow freely across continents, helping with global commerce and trade. The top shipping companies in this industry are not just transporters. They are, in fact, pivotal to driving international trade, regulations, and economic dynamics. Whether you’re looking for chartering jobs or you’re simply curious to know more about the industry, in this article, we’ll be diving into the top five container shipping companies based on their cargo capacity, fleet size, and industry positioning.    Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC)    Number Of Ships: 800 approximately.    TEU Capacity: 5,614,057    MSC was founded in 1970 and is Swiss-based. It has recently reached the top spot in the global shipping industry with some strategic acquisitions and enhancements to their existing fleet, leading to serious expansion. This aggressive expansion led to the addition of nearly 100 ships, allowing MSC to become a dominant force in the industry. Despite this expansion, however, MSC has a strong focus on green technologies and digitalisation in an attempt to reduce its environmental footprint and improve operational efficiencies to help it to grow even further.    APM-Maersk    Number Of Ships: 675 approximately    TEU Capacity: 4,117,136    Hailing from Denmark, APM-Maersk has long been a frontrunner in the container shipping industry. The company is well-renowned for its size and efforts to improve environmental sustainability not just within its company but within the industry as a whole. Maersk’s pioneering efforts have seen the company make significant strides in integrating green fuel alternatives. They also have already integrated digital solutions into their operations, something that many other container shipping companies aim to replicate.    CMA CGM Group    Number Of Ships: 624 approximately    TEU Capacity: 3,578,494  The French shipping giant CMA CGM Group was established in 1978 and currently holds third position in the standings based on size of the company. Due to the forward-thinking leadership of Jacques Saade, the company has grown significantly through mergers and strategic expansions, which has allowed CMA CGM to operate within 150 shipping routes across the globe. With ecological initiatives being heavily invested in, particularly with the adoption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) the company has long held a commitment to innovation and sustainability.    COSCO Shipping Lines    Number Of Ships: 490 approximately    TEU Capacity: 3,054,323    The China Ocean Shipping Company is more commonly known as COSCO. It is based in China and is one of the biggest conglomerates in the container shipping industry. The company has recently slipped to fourth in the list due to the rise in mergers from CMA CGM, however, COSCO is expected to boost their capacity in the very near future significantly. With an extensive network and digital transformation initiatives, COSCO is set to continue to remain robust in such a competitive market, with many growth plans due to come into existence in the next few years.    Hapag-Lloyd    Number Of Ships: 266 approximately    TEU Capacity: 1,963,934    The German company Hapag-Lloyd is well-known in the industry and comes with a rich history dating all the way back to 1970. The company was born from the merger of Hamburg-American Line and the North German company Lloyd. While many companies focus on green practices, Hapag-Lloyd takes pride in their traditional approach of being highly regarded for their customer service, operational efficiency, and innovative practices. Two of the most important features for the future of the company are its use of digital tools to help boost route management and customer interactions to improve loyalty and lifetime value.    Conclusion    Despite its dynamic and evolving nature, the container shipping industry will always be the backbone of global trade. Influenced predominantly by economic shifts, trade policies, and technological innovations, the top five container shipping companies in the industry will continue to lead the market - not just in terms of size but also due to their pioneering approaches to many industry challenges. With a continued focus on sustainable practices and reducing their carbon footprint, we expect to see many companies in the industry follow suit. The strategic direction of these industry giants is only going to shape what the future of the industry will look like.  "

                     CBZ to monitor risks to protect 330% profit
                    ","CBZ Holdings Limited (CBZ) will monitor commodity price volatility and El Niño-induced drought risks to strategise faster, after recording a 330% increase in profit after tax in 2023. In its financial year ended December 31, 2023, CBZ recorded an increase in profit in Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL$) terms after tax rose to ZWL$693,56 billion, compared to 2022’s prior figure of ZWL$161,28 billion. The increase was on the back of its non-net interest income soaring to ZWL$1,85 trillion during the period, against the 2022 figure of ZWL$859, 44 billion. However, given global commodity price volatility and El Niño-induced drought this year, CBZ will be closely monitoring the situation to strategise better to protect its gains from 2023. “In 2024, the IMF [International Monetary Fund] expects global growth to remain flat at 3,1%, with the risks to the outlook largely balanced. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to recover to 3,8%,” CBZ’s new chairman Luxon Zembe said, in a statement attached to the group’s annual financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2023. “In Zimbabwe, however, government expects growth to moderate further to 3,5% as the adverse effects of the El Niño effect become more pronounced, particularly on the agricultural and related sectors. Relatively strong performance is, however, still expected in the mining, accommodation and food services, and wholesale and retail trade sectors.” He continued: “The downside risks to the growth projections include, among others, prolonged weak commodity prices, especially for base metals and PGMs, potential further disruptions to supply chains and trade flows, and currency weaknesses.” “The Group will continue to monitor these developments for quicker detection of, and response to, emerging risks and opportunities,” he concluded. Driving the non-net interest income were unrealised gains on foreign currency exchange, fair value adjustments on investment properties owing to the foreign currency increases, commission and income and net income from forex trading. However, as the now defunct Zimdollar depreciated by over 700% last year, CBZ’s operating expenditure more than doubled to over ZWL$1 trillion, from a 2022 comparative of ZWL$412,39 billion. This was driven by increases in staff and administrative costs. “The board seeks to strike a balance between the need to provide competitive financial returns and the expectations of stakeholders and shareholders regarding governance in the context of growing change and regulatory complexity,” Zembe said. “The board has done a commendable job of establishing the Group’s strategic direction and making sure the Group successfully manages risk. Our primary emphasis continues to be setting measurable goals to support a positive company culture that is in line with our steadfast dedication to our stakeholders.” Net interest income was recorded at ZWL$547,76 billion during the period under review, up nearly 55% from the 2022 comparative. In terms of loans and advances to customers, CBZ recorded a near 145% increase to ZWL$2,07 trillion during the period from a 2022 comparative of ZWL$846,79 billion. Commercial loans to the private sector, agriculture, mining, manufacturing and distribution drove lending. “The extension of the multi-currency system to 2030 provided the much-needed policy clarity and consistency for the given period, thereby enabling the Group to effectively underwrite long term products,” Zembe said. “The Group also continued to leverage on its strong investment in intellectual, manufactured, and financial capital to continuously develop and offer solutions that satisfy the needs of its wide range of clients. These included, among others, enhancement of products and mobilisation of external lines of credit to better meet the loan requirements of industry.” Deposits rose to ZWL5,57 trillion as at the end of the period under review, from a 2022 comparative of ZWL3,26 trillion. Increased lending and financial securities helped grow CBZ’s total assets to ZWL8,25 trillion at the end of last year, an increase of nearly 80% from 2022. "

                     ZCTU mourns over low wages
                    ","THE Zimbabwe Congress Trade Union (ZCTU) secretary-general Japhet Moyo has encouraged national employment councils (NECs) to come up with wage minimums in line with the cost of living. This follows increasing complaints from workers that wages are not being raised in line with the cost of living, after the country’s former currency, the Zimdollar (ZWL$), lost over 700% of its value last year, which prompted workers to demand to be paid in line with inflation, pegged against the greenback. The NEC for the Commercial Sectors of Zimbabwe has since thus raised wages so that the lowest-paid employee takes home US$295 or its Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) equivalent, from US$253. “We encourage parties to make sure they agree on a living wage or wages and salaries above the PDL (poverty datum line),” Moyo said, in an interview with NewsDay Business. At US$295, the cost of living for one person translates to nearly ZiG4 000 using the official forex rate. Last week, the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency reported the Total Consumption Poverty Line for one person was ZiG650,26 in April 2024. For food, the costs for one person was recorded at ZiG424,95 based on a low calorie diet. However, most of the economy uses the much higher forex rates prevalent on the parallel market. “This is a collective bargaining agreement for the commercial industry. This was entered or agreed by the registered employer organisation and registered trade union in the commercial sector,” Moyo said. “NECs enjoy delegated powers, therefore, it is within their powers to determine minimum conditions of employment and wages within their sector. The parties to the NECs are answerable to their members who mandate them regularly to negotiate or review wages and salaries.” He accused NECs of failing to represent workers fully and that workers felt betrayed. “Over the years very few parties at the various NECs have managed to agree on wages and salaries above the PDL,” Moyo said. Meanwhile, the Public Service Labour and Social Welfare ministry has cancelled the registration certificate of the NEC for food and allied industry for failing to submit audited financial statements for the year 2023 to date. The move, according to analysts, will have a domino effect on NECs that have not complied with the Labour Amendment section 56 as well. “It is hereby notified that I as the Acting Registrar of Labour, has in terms of section 59 (4) as read with section 63A of the Labour Act [Chapter 28:01] cancelled the registration certificate of National Employment Council for the food and allied industry with immediate effect,” the ministry said, in a letter dated April 22, 2024. “For avoidance of doubt section 59 (4) provides as follows: An employment council shall submit an audited account of its revenue and expenditure to the Registrar within the period specified in section 63; and; submit at the written request of the Registrar, no later than seven days after receiving the request, or after such longer period as the Registrant may for good cause allow, such written report on any matter as the Registrar may reasonably require in connection with its operations.” The letter indicated that any failure on the part of the employment council to comply with those requirements constitutes justifiable grounds for the registrar to cancel a certificate. “National Employment Council for food and allied industries has not submitted audited financial statements for the year 2023 to date as such I have cancelled your registration certificate with immediate effect. Please be advised accordingly,” the letter added. "

                     ‘Entrepreneurs need to enter into alliances’
                    ","BUY Zimbabwe founder Munyaradzi Hwengwere says entrepreneurs need to enter into economic alliances to improve Zimbabwe’s economy. Speaking at an entrepreneurial business seminar last week called: Expanding Opportunities Through Meet-ups, which was aimed at encouraging networking between start-up business owners and entrepreneurs, Hwengwere said young people needed to be trustworthy to expand their networks. “We have young people who have realised the power of networks, but instead of getting frustrated about it, they have decided to come together and become the network itself. There is a need for us to realise the opportunities that come with networks and leverage on the opportunities in Zimbabwe and across the world towards success and improve the ecosystems of the economy in Zimbabwe,” Hwengwere said during the event which was organised Yarutso Car Rentals and Yarutso Adventure founder, Victor Madzedze. “There is a need to improve attitude, eagerness and the ability to fulfil promises, which are the fundamentals of competence in networking. Humility must walk together with intelligence, focus, hard work and trust and this is one of the challenges most young people have that they are not willing to learn and that leads to arrogance.” He urged young people to be humble enough to learn from those more experienced to expand networks and ecosystems. Chief executive officer of Qupa Micro-finance — an entity under ZB Financing Holdings Limited — Jade Tsokodayi said entrepreneurs must utilise all sources of financing around them when starting businesses. The CEO noted that this would avoid the debt crises that come with borrowing from micro-financing institutions. Tsokodayi encouraged entrepreneurs to establish their businesses first before approaching micro financing institutions. “So, for financing, do not look further than yourself, you need to make sure that you redeem all and everything around you. When you are more established you then approach micro-finance institutions like us. When you are still starting, the cost of financing could be exorbitant and you might end up in debt instead of flourishing as a business,” he said. “When starting, utilise family, friends and the fools around you. So many people are so successful due to their uncles who had money. Some are up there because they had friends who were well established, and some are successful because they had fools out there with the money, but without ideas.” He encouraged small businesses to bank their money so that they have traceable financial statements that are necessary when one needs to get financing from micro-finance institutions for capital. Tsokodayi also said entrepreneurs should see micro-finance institutions as partners rather than loan sharks. “If you borrow, please pay for you to maintain relationships with these financial institutions. Remember, if you are a bad creditor, you are blacklisted from getting any form of financing. This is a form of professionalism that any business needs and when it gets to a point that you are blacklisted, being successful will be very hard,” he said. “When you are confident that you are established, you come to us, and we will take you through every process to proper financing. We will need you to put all your financial statements on the table. We have realised that most people are missing out on basic financial services because they do not bank their money.” Tsokodayi urged entrepreneurs to have several lines of income to sustain their businesses, while embracing networking in their business plans in the process. “When establishing your businesses, never rely on one source of income. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. When you decide to be an entrepreneur, never lose focus and the reason why you started in the first place. Networking is also the key to success,” he added. "

                     African Sun flush with cash for capital investments
                    ","HOSPITALITY group, African Sun Limited (ASL), has planned major capital investments into refurbishments of its properties and upscaling its information technology for the year amid a projected increase in business. The commitment comes after the firm increased its capital commitments last year to US$11,01 million, up 20,22% on the 2022 figures. Funding for these capital investments is expected to come from normal operating cash flows and debt finance, as the firm entered the year in a liquid position with a current ratio of 1,76. In a statement accompanying its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, ASL chairman Constantine Chikosi said they were expecting robust business from growing demand for meetings, incentives, conferencing and events. “While macroeconomic uncertainty around inflation and currency instability persists, we are fortunate to have the liquidity and financial flexibility to make prudent investments, aligning with our vision of ensuring a seamless and enjoyable guest experience,” he said. “During 2024, we have planned significant capital investments into enabling information technology and further hotel refurbishments. These investments set the stage for a sustainable growth trajectory for the group and enhanced returns for our shareholders.” Chikosi said the group was engaging financiers to support its capital commitments for the year. “The group is currently in discussions with leading financial institutions to secure funding to complement its healthy cash balances for deployment in carrying out accelerated material hotel refurbishment projects,” he revealed. The group’s improved liquidity position comes as it is operating free of debt, recording cash and cash equivalents of US$10,87 million as of the end of last year, although this was 5% below the 2022 buffer. Chikosi said the cash deployment strategy last year mainly focused on completing targeted hotel refurbishments to enhance guest experience. “During the period under review, we continued to prioritise strategic capital allocation initiatives,” he said. “This included the completion of the refurbishment of the remaining 46 rooms at Hwange Safari Lodge and the refurbishment of the public areas which is progressing well. The refurbishment of the public areas at Troutbeck and the Great Zimbabwe conference centre was also completed during the period under review.” However, the group’s operating and other expenses remain a threat to profitability as these rose by a combined 38,18% last year. Chikosi attributed the increase to exchange rate volatility, inflationary pressures and the crystallisation of expenses in US dollars as the economy increased the dollarisation pace. Such challenges saw the firm’s income tax expense also expand to US$2,09 million during the period under review, from nearly US$592 000 in 2022. Profit after tax from continuing operations dropped by 93,14% to US$521 045 in the period under review, from US$7,6 million in 2022. “The group will continue to monitor costs and implement various cost-saving initiatives,” Chikosi said. Increased revenue of US$54,73 million, up 30% against the comparable period, managed to keep the group from entering into a loss-making position, he said. “The improved performance was driven by firmer average daily rates which closed 2023 at US$110, an increase of 39% against US$79 achieved during the comparable period as a result of changes in customer mix,” Chikosi said. “Hotel occupancies increased to 52%, 6 percentage points above 2022. Revenue per available room for accommodation revenue increased by 58% to US$57, up from US$36 in the comparative period.” Total assets rose to US$142,33 million during the period under review, from a 2022 comparative of US$121,52 million. This was driven by an increase in the rights of use of assets, the lessee’s right to occupy, operate, or hold a leased asset during the rental period. "

                    ","VICTORIA Falls Stock Exchange-listed WestProp Holdings Limited yesterday began the development of the US$300 million Hills Luxury Golf Estate as its urban renewal push intensifies. Apart from the construction of the world class golf course, the development will see the construction of villas, apartments, townhouses, country club, hotel, tennis and swimming academy and a shopping mall. The golf course will be modelled after an 18-hole golf course used in the PGA Tour. “Today’s launch, which will continue with the groundbreaking, starts the development of the rebranded Hills Luxury Estate, formerly known as Warren Hills Golf Club, into a mixed live, work, shop and play luxury lifestyle estate,” WestProp chief executive officer Ken Sharpe said yesterday. “This is part of our contribution to the urban renewal projects as endorsed by the second republic. We are creating value of over US$300 million through this project. We are confident that by the time it is completed, the value of the investment of this project will have grown substantially.” He said that the project would add 70 million bricks to their target of one billion bricks by 2050. “This project that we are undertaking today is a legacy project. It brings many firsts for sub-Saharan Africa and to Zimbabwe. I believe this project will forever change perceptions of Harare and Zimbabwe,” Sharpe added. “We are on a mission to make sure that one billion bricks are put in the ground by 2050 on all our projects and that includes Pokugara Residential Estate, Millennium Heights, Pomona City and the Hills Golf Estate. This project is going to consume an estimated 70 million bricks. So, this project alone will double our bricks to take us to over 150 million, almost 15% of the vision being realised.” WestProp roped in renowned golf course designer Peter Matkovich and top  architect Joan Balagué Capdet to the project. “It is with great privilege that I welcome Joan Balagué Capdet. He flew in all the way yesterday from Barcelona, Spain. He is the man who designed this beautiful estate that we are unveiling today. He came up with a concept plan. His first time walking on this land was about two years ago,” Sharpe noted. “He was involved and instrumental in doing the town plan to incorporate this mixed-use development into a smart city, where we have on the walls around your beautiful pictures of what it is that is being designed. He designed the homes.”  Sharpe said Matkovich will create an 18-hole world championship golf course. “Peter came to see me a few years ago, he said to me, I not only designed the best golf courses in Africa and have won the most awards for the best golf courses, but I  am also a man of the soil of Zimbabwe,” Sharpe said. “He was born in Zimbabwe and he wanted to come back to Zimbabwe and leave his legacy, his mark in his later years on the best course that he has designed.” Apart from this development, others WestProp projects include the Millennium Heights which is ongoing, Pokugara Residential Estate, Pomona City (ongoing), The Mall of Zimbabwe and Millennium Heights Office Park.

                     Watch ZiG closely: Fews Net
                    ","FOOD security initiative, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fews Net), says the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency will have to be tracked regularly to see its sustainability, amid worsening living conditions. Last month saw the introduction of the ZiG, replacing the battered Zimdollar that had experienced a sharp depreciation. In its latest food security update for April, Fews Net said households were expected to increase their reliance on coping strategies to meet their food needs due to the poor harvest and inflation. This comes as Zimbabwe’s 2023/24 agricultural season is in the midst of suffering from the El Niño-induced drought, leading to a state of national disaster being declared on April 3, last month. “On April 5, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe introduced a new local currency, the Zimbabwe Gold. The structured currency, which is said to be backed by gold and other precious minerals and foreign currency reserves, was pegged at 1 ZiG to ZWL$2 499 (previous currency) and 13,56 ZiG to US$1 when launched,” Fews Net said. “By mid-April, electronic and mobile money platforms had adjusted to the new currency, while ZiG notes and coins became available from April 30. It will be critical to continue monitoring the markets following the establishment of a new currency.” The uncertainty of ZiG has caused businesses and retailers to offer different forex exchange rates ranging from US$1:ZiG14 to ZiG16. Officially, the forex rate is US$1:ZiG13,43. Fews Net noted how the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency had started a new data series for monitoring the poverty datum lines using the ZiG. The national average Food Poverty Datum Line per person per month for April was assessed to be ZiG425 and the average total consumption poverty line at ZiG650. Fews Net said the increased reliance on coping strategies by households will be driven by the poor harvest, limited seasonal agricultural labour opportunities, and high food prices. This is expected to drive area-level crisis outcomes in typical deficit-producing areas in the south, east, west, and extreme north into the post-harvest period. “In typical surplus-producing parts of the Mashonaland provinces and other areas, stressed (IPC Phase 2) area-level outcomes are anticipated to emerge as the poor harvest, limited crop sales and increased competition for income-earning opportunities affect household purchasing power, with some poor households likely to engage in coping strategies indicative of crisis (IPC Phase 3) to meet their food needs,” Fews Net said.

                     Zim to achieve zero tariffs by 2035
                    ","THE Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC) says 97% of the country’s tariff lines will go to zero by 2035, as it urged local companies to prepare themselves to trade under the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA). This comes amid revelations that about a third of the local manufacturers are ready to compete in the AfCFTA. The AfCFTA is an initiative that was adopted by the African Union to drive intra-African trade, thereby boosting economies on the continent. According to CTC, under the protocol of trade, member states of the AfCFTA are expected to reduce and eventually eliminate tariffs to boost intra-African trade. To do that, AfCFTA member states are to propose tariff liberalisation schedules which most nations have been slow to implement as it would lower the tax revenue. Zimbabwe’s tariff liberalisation schedule has 6 606 total tariff lines, which have been categorised as categories A, B, and C. Category A is the non-sensitive list which has 5 956 tariff lines, category B is the sensitive list which has 455 tariff lines, and category C is the exclusive list which has 195 tariff lines. Zimbabwe resubmitted its final tariffs order for technical verification to the AfCFTA secretariat to enter the second phase of the guided trade initiatives, which pilots preferential trade between member states. “It is not that we are exactly late, but it is a process where the government of Zimbabwe helps us make the tariff offers to submit to the AfCFTA secretariat,” CTC economist Tawanda Katsande told NewsDay Business in an interview. “We submitted our first offer in 2022 and we got some comments, and we were addressing the comments. Now, the official position is that we have again sent the revised version offer to the AfCfTA secretariat and we are awaiting to receive comments from them again, so we move forward.” Katsande said Zimbabwe will start implementing the tariff offers when the verification process is complete. “When we complete this verification process and we gazette the AfCFTA offer, that is when we start to gazette the phase downs according to the categories,” he said. “So, if you count correctly, the first phase down will be in 2025 and the second will be in 2035. But eventually, 97% of our tariff lines will go to zero tariffs by 2035. “The industry needs to understand this to prepare themselves for AfCFTA and to know which category their products fall in. So, the tariff offer we were talking about has three categories.” Katsande said the AfCFTA would be of much benefit to the local industries as it offered a bigger market and allowed the movement of goods duty-free. However, the duty-free movement is only if the products are produced completely through the county’s own raw materials. “We are already trading in Comesa, in Sadc, Ecowas, and AfCFTA is just increasing the market in the region,” Katsande said. The push to participate in the AfCFTA comes as countries seek to get more value from a market with combined gross domestic product of over US$3,4 trillion. "

Cumulatively, US$395 million had been spent on these projects as at March 31, 2024, against a total project budget of US$468 million. The firm spent US$340 million on the smelter expansion and SO2 abatement plant against a total project budget of US$521 million. The report noted that US$27 million had been spent on the implementation of the 35 megawatts solar plant project to date, against a budget of US$37 million.  The company also expended US$27 million on the execution of the Base Metal Refinery refurbishment project, against a total budget of US$190 million. The projects are part of Zimplats’ US$1,8 billion expansion programme. In light of the softer metal pricing environment, management implemented various cash preservation measures which included labour rationalisation and capital project re-scheduling within cash constraints. In April, 67 employees, being 1,6% of total permanent workforce, were retrenched.    “Cost containment initiatives implemented in the quarter prior progressed in the period under review, resulting in a 2% reduction in total operating cash costs from the prior quarter,” the report read in part. “Operating cash costs increased by 7% year-on-year, primarily due to the 9% and 7% increase in mining and milling volumes respectively, benefiting from cost mitigation efforts which helped contain the impact of persistent input inflation.” The focus of exploration activities in the period under review was the geotechnical logging of the core drilled at Ngezi (ML37) and updating the group’s geological and mineral resource models with the assay results received. Mining volumes were unchanged from prior quarter but increased by 9% year-on-year benefiting from the pillar reclamation operations at Rukodzi Mine and the continued ramp-up of production from Mupani Mine, which is under development. Pillar reclamation activities also benefited 6E (platinum, palladium, rhodium, gold, ruthenium and iridium) head grade, which was 2% higher year-on-year. The 1% reduction in grade from the prior quarter was due to an increased contribution of lower-grade Mupani Mine development ore and dilution from mining across geological structures. Milled volumes increased by 7% and 3% from the comparative and prior quarter, respectively. The report showed that a scheduled reline of the mills at the Selous Metallurgical Complex was deferred to the fourth quarter of financial year 2024, the volumes from which also benefited from improved milling rates and running time, in line with higher ore supply. Concentrate recoveries were stable versus the prior quarter and increased by 5% from the comparative quarter, resulting in a 2% quarter-on-quarter and 14% year-on-year increase in the volume of 6E in concentrate produced. 6E metal in final product improved by 12% year-on-year and was 1% higher than the prior quarter. Transfers from stocks to operating costs amounted to US$2,8 million during the period, in line with the movement in inventory across the value chain. Cash costs of metal produced increased by 5% and 1% from the comparative and prior quarter, respectively. Operating cash unit cost of US$821 per 6E ounce was marginally below that of the prior quarter and declined by 6% year-on-year, benefiting from volume gains which offset inflationary pressures experienced on electricity.  ministries and with stakeholders from the private and non-profit sectors,” the bank said "

                     Econet in a remittance first for Zimbabwe
                    ","Zimbabwe’s largest telecommunications and technology company, Econet Wireless, has achieved an Africa first by opening two free remittance corridors into the country, completely eliminating the cost to both sender and receiver. Econet has partnered with its sister company, Sasai Money Transfer, to enable individuals and companies in the United Kingdom and South Africa to send money into Zimbabwe free of charge, starting today (May 2, 2024). The receiver also cashes out of their EcoCash wallet for free.  International remittances attract a charge of up to 15% for the sender, while the receiver is charged 3% when cashing-out.  Econet Wireless Zimbabwe chief executive, Douglas Mboweni explained that the latest decision is aimed at helping Zimbabweans to weather the acute challenges caused by the drought.  The country recently declared a national disaster over a drought caused by the climate event known as El Niño, which has left more than 2.7 million people in need of food aid.  “We hope Zimbabweans in the Diaspora will use the savings to send more money home to their families,” Mboweni said.  “The majority of remittances to Zimbabwe are conducted through these two main corridors (the UK and South Africa). We don’t have to pay any third parties on those corridors, because we rely on a sister company in the group, which agreed to help out,” he said. He said he hopes the move by Econet will encourage other companies facilitating remittances into Zimbabwe to reduce their fees, noting that it was time that remittances into Africa in general were brought down “to assist with the continent’s economic development agenda”.  Mboweni  added  that the initiative was in support of government efforts to increase diaspora remittances coming into the country through formal channels. Econet's extensive EcoCash agent network ensures that even people in remote rural areas have access to low-cost financial services, reducing the need for recipients to travel long distances to collect cash. Econet said Remittance transfers will be facilitated through the EcoCash US dollar wallet, which is accessible by dialling *153# on an EcoCash registered Econet line.  Senders in the UK and South Africa can access Sasai Money Transfer by downloading the Sasai Money Transfer App on the Google Play Store and on the App Store.

                     Metbank eyes more forex loans to drive profitability
                    ","METBANK is underwriting foreign currency loans to improve United States dollar income as it seeks to grow the bottom line after recording a 73,08% increase in profit after tax to ZWL$223,58 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023. In the previous year, after tax profit was ZWL$129,17 billion. A monetary gain and fair value adjustment were the main drivers of profit after tax. In a statement accompanying the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, released yesterday, Metbank board chairperson Linda Chipunza said underwriting foreign currency loans would ensure profitability after a challenging period. “The bank’s focus remained on increasing foreign currency revenue streams through underwriting loans denominated in foreign currency to act as a hedge against exchange rate depreciation and inflation that will also produce long-term, sustainable profitability,” she said. “Further, the bank continued focusing on its digitisation drive in order to enhance customer satisfaction and convenience. Operational and financial resilience is of paramount importance to the bank supported by robust business continuity and succession planning arrangements.” Chipunza said the bank recorded comprehensive income of ZWL$230,5 billion in the year under review from ZWL$132,3 billion in 2022. During the period under review, the bank posted a monetary gain of ZWL$77,23 billion translating to an increase of nearly 1 666% compared to the prior year. The gain was driven by the exchange rate volatility when the now defunct Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL) depreciated by over 700% in 2023. This depreciation also saw the bank make a fair value gain on investment property to ZWL$271,51 billion, from ZWL$146,8 billion in the comparative 2022 period. Thus, total net income was recorded at ZWL$261,84 billion, but kept down by a net interest expense of ZWL$20,3 billion. Loans and advances to customers dropped by nearly 82% during the period under review to ZWL$3,08 billion, from the prior year as the bank cut back on ZWL loans. Chipunza said the revaluation gains of the bank’s investment property portfolio was because of strategic actions by Metbank to hedge its balance sheet against exchange rate and inflationary pressures. This revaluation propelled the bank’s total assets to ZWL$787,01 billion during the period under review, up 67,5% on the 2022 comparative. “The bank remained compliant with the revised regulatory minimum capital requirements for commercial banks, and the bank is pleased that it has continued to grow its capital base well beyond the minimum thresholds,” Chipunza said. “Going forward, the bank’s capitalisation will continue to be driven through organic growth with any anticipated shortfalls being covered through shareholder injections.” However, a threat to the bank’s profitability remains its expenses as operating expenditure more than tripled to ZWL$102,12 billion during the period under review from 2022. Administrative expenses were the main driver behind the increase. “The operating environment remains challenging, but we remain optimistic that the bank will maintain an upward growth trajectory, anchored by its strong statement of its financial position,” Chipunza said. “In the implementation of the bank’s strategy for the delivery of unique customer value propositions, innovation and digitalisation remain our core objectives. Metbank will continue to engage all the relevant funding partners in raising long-term capital to support the country’s economic development aspirations.” Deposits for the period under review, rose 146% to ZWL$64,36 billion from the 2022 comparative.

                     Kuvimba CEO steps down
                    ","KUVIMBA Mining House (KMH) group chief executive officer Simbarashe Chinyemba is reportedly leaving the mining giant to join the Mutapa Investment Fund as chief investment officer, NewsDay Business can reveal. A distinguished fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (UK), Chinyemba replaced David Brown, who stepped down in August 2021 as group CEO for KMH. Prior to that, Chinyemba was KMH chief operating officer. “He is leaving KMH for Mutapa as chief investment officer,” a reliable source told NewsDay Business. “Under his leadership, defunct mines were resuscitated and turned into profitable ventures. These include Zimbabwe Alloys, Shamva and Sandawana, among others.” Under Chinyemba’s strategy to streamline operations and decentralise decision making, the diversified mining group last year restructured its operations into four main clusters — gold, energy,  platinum group minerals (PGMs) and bulk metals. The strategy set the mining firm on a growth path and enhanced its resilience. Within the energy cluster there is Bindura Nickel Corporation and Sandawana, the gold  cluster has Shamva Mine, Jena Mine and Freda Rebecca, bulk metals cluster has Zim Alloys with Great Dyke Investments making up the PGMs cluster. Each cluster is headed by a team of technocrats, with many years’ experience in the mining sectors. Chinyemba had plans to list the company on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange. In addition, he pushed for gender parity in the traditionally male-dominated mining business by insisting on a quota for women working for KMH. The mining giant participated actively in community-based corporate social responsibility initiatives during his stint at the helm. KMH holds some of Zimbabwe’s best mining assets. The mining firm is now under Mutapa, Zimbabwe’s state sovereign wealth fund. Efforts to get a comment from KMH and Chinyemba were fruitless. "
