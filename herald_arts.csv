His weekend performance at the Castle Tankard, attended by thousands of people in Harare, is testimony to this. After Master H, Freeman, Bling 4, DJs Fantan, Ribhe and Levels performed, Macheso and his Orchestra Mberikwazvo band came on to the stage at around 7pm. The sungura doyen did not disappoint his fans, churning out his old hits like “Shedia” and “Waikupanei Gungwa”, with the revellers backing him and singing along to his songs. He also performed a new song, “Wajaira Kundirova Ndakadhakwa”, which is on his album to be released in August. On stage, Macheso was accompanied by his dancer Selemani “Majuice” Mpochi, who was overshadowed by new senior dancer Shame “Kariba”  Chidewo. Although Macheso was the main act of the concert, other musicians who were on the list per-formed well. Zimdancell sensation Emegy “Freeman” Chizanga nailed it when he performed his hit song,“Man to Man.” The trio of Chillspot Records DJs — Fantan, Ribhe and Levels — charmed the crowd. Fantan braved that day’s chilly weather by performing shirtless. Fast-rising Zimdancehall chanter, Hillary “Master H” Marufu was well-received by the revellers. Master H was happy to perform at the Castle Tankard for the first time. “I’m super excited to perform on this special occasion, this shows that the public is appreciating my music. “It gives me pride to see that thousands of people know all your lyrics, this shows I’m doing a great job in this industry,” he said. Another upcoming Zim-hip-hop artiste, Farai “Bling 4” Gadzani also put up a good show. He performed a song featuring Silent Killer titled “Tisu Takatyora Mabhanditi” that had the crowd on their feet. The Mbare-based musician was excited to be included in that big event and to rub shoulders with high-profile artistes like Freeman and Macheso. “I just want to thank the event organisers for including me on this special occasion,” he said. Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Delta Corporation head of corporate affairs Patricia Murambinda said the inclusion of upcoming artistes on the line up was of great importance as it thrust them into the                                             spotlight. “Events like these are attended by the masses, so adding the upcoming musicians can help them to gain fame. “So many people were asking us why we did not haveWinky D this time, he is not the only artiste we have in Zimbabwe. We have to give others a chance to perform at these events.” Murambinda  said that Delta wanted to nurture and promote young talent, and not only the famous names. “As Delta, we have many events that aim to promote young talent, like the Road to Fame and Chibuku Neshamwari Dance Festival. “We are not obliged to promote high-profile artistes only, but to uplift the upcoming  ones also,” said Murambinda.

https://www.herald.co.zw/the-unveiled-take-fans-to-the-next-level-at-dvd-recording/,The Unveiled take fans to ‘The Next Level’ at DVD recording,"Entertainment Editor Young, vibrant and smart choral outfit, The Unveiled, left an indelible mark during their DVD recording held on Saturday at 7 Arts Theatre in Avondale, Harare. The recording, which ran under the theme, “Next Level – Making Jesus Famous,” saw the auditorium packed to the rafters as fans enjoyed every moment. The group’s new songs were well-received by the crowd. The new songs include “Mweya Mutsvene,” “Dururai Mweya Mutsvene,” “Warrior,” “Take Over,” and “Rise Up.” True to their name, they unveiled themselves to the world with a performance that suggested that they could be the next big thing to happen in Zimbabwe’s music industry. They stamped their authority on the gospel genre as the next act to take over the baton from The Charambas, Shingisai Suluma, Prince Mafukidze, Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave, and Mechanic Manyeruke among others. The youthful group brings a new vibe, energy and style to the gospel music scene. With such music, they are not only entertaining the young and old, but are challenging the established musicians to step up their game. The event was divided into  in two segments — first, they came clad in African attire which matched their cool, worship songs and the second one was the up-tempo dance vibe. They performed the crowd-favourite “Tungamira,” which sent the fans into a frenzy. They were later joined on stage by seasoned gospel singer Tembalami to perform “Gore Rino”. The show indeed took fans to the “Next Level”. It also saw top local musicians like Janet Manyowa, Everton Mlalazi, The Cherayis, and Tembalami performing. The “elders”, as they were christened at the show, put up a good performance with their old hits. Each time they were on stage, they pledged their support to the new “babies” in the game. Comedian “Nigel Tha Slick Pastor” sailed flawlessly as the master of ceremony. This time around he didn’t bring his comic attire on stage,  but was clad in a black slim-fit suit, as a sign of respect to the DVD recording. The event was well attended by local gospel musicians, including the Makombes, who just flew in the country ahead of their collaboration with local acts for their show next month. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/cresta-mbare-the-last-supper/,Cresta Mbare: The last supper,"Talent Chimutambgi-Lifestyle Writer It is almost mid-morning in Harare’s sprawling suburb of Mbare and some of the trendiest and latest vehicles compete for parking space. Out of the cars alight ladies and gentlemen clad in expensive designer clothes looking for a sumptuous lunch. Here, everything from shops to houses, roads is inexplicably busy. Ordinarily, this is not a good place to be. To many Americans and Western Europeans, Mbare is a classic example of a ghetto, what Trench Town is to Jamaica; a place for the poor and vice; a place where nothing right happens.  “Can anything good come out of Trench Town?” Bob Marley would sing. At the main business complex everything is busy and dilapidated, but here, there is one place that attracted the who-is-who of Harare. This place was called “Cresta Mbare”. Cresta is one of Southern Africa’s biggest hospitality groups running hotels and restaurants that offer delicious food tapestries. Remember Jameson Hotel, Cresta Oasis Hotel, Cresta Lodge and Cresta Churchill, that are all run professionally?  There must be something uniquely special for some ramshackle backyard eating place in Mbare to be equated to Cresta’s delicacies. The brains behind Cresta Mbare was Gogo Samuriwo Mutuma, an larger than life character who made every customer felt loved and at home.  Gogo Samuriwo It was her magic touch that made the rich and famous to leave the most decent hotels in Harare and navigate their way to Mbare. She was the magnet that brought people of diverse backgrounds together. Gogo Samuriwo-Mutuma started his catering business around 1980 at her home serving vendors and revellers at Mbare Musika and in town using a car as a mobile restaurant. At her house along Mzingeli Street, she continued to operate a kitchen until she was forced to abandon the home business during “Operation Murambatsvina” which was aimed at cleaning up towns. Before her husband who was a Harare City Council employee died in 1999, he had helped  her formalise her business to meet  elementary catering standards. She started her canteen trading under the name “Bisto” because she used to use Bisto relish powder in her soups and stews.  She did not name the place Cresta, as it was popularly known, but it was the customers who coined the name because they believed the dishes and service being offered were actually better or of the same quality with the renowned hotel group. She used to supply Chibuku Breweries employees in the industrial areas with sadza during lunch hour, but ended up opening a branch in situ.  Gogo Samuriwo was known for her usual saying to the customers, “ Sadza for the smart gentleman. One big mukombe for murume wanhasi. Big piece for madam. Vakomana ngavapihwe sadza rakawanda vanoputa fodya. More meat for musikana akageza.” She was familiar with her surroundings since she grew up in Mbare and went to Chirodzo Primary School and Harare High. Her son, Munyaradzi, said Gogo was very determined having started her canteen some years back. “This attracted most prominent people to come and buy food at the canteen. Most of them included renowned businessmen Philip Chiyangwa, and Wicknell Chivhayo as well as former ministers Webster Shamu and David Parirenyatwa and former Mashonaland governor Feber Chidarikire, among other prominent figures,” said Munyaradzi. “Soccer clubs that used to frequent the place include Dynamos, Masvingo United, Harare City Football Club and the now defunct Blackpool.  “Some of the famous Mbare footballers like the late Ashton Nyazika, and Lewis Kutinyu all ate there. Also, the Chillspot Family and other Zimdancehall artistes like Sir Calaz and the late Soul Jah Love were regular customers.” Munyaradzi said Gogo Samuriwo achieved a lot through her entrepreneurship skills. “Through her business, Gogo Samuriwo bought properties in Mufakose (where she stayed until her death), in Belvedere West, Westgate and Mbare. She also has a farm in Norton,” he said. As an accomplished Zanu PF party cadre who was brave, her home was used for political meetings even during her absence. Hazel Muguti, Gogo Samuriwo’s daughter, who is currently in the United Kingdom, said her mother did not discriminate against anyone, adding  that she was a mother to the whole community.  Gogo Samuriwo (left) and her daughter Hazel “Our mother taught us to treat everyone with great respect and she would insist that a child does not belong to the parents, but to the whole community. The statement itself indicates the type of mother she was,” said Hazel. “She was a loving mother, she loved everyone despite your background and here we grew up mingling with children from extended families, but one couldn’t see the difference because we were treated equally. To us and the entire community, her death is a huge loss, and even in the political space,” she said. “Her relationship with her husband was so close. Despite having liberation war credentials, she at one time to have seemed abandoned politics until her husband encouraged her to the extent of becoming more active than ever.” Hazel said, her mother taught her to treat other people with love and respect. However her death came as a surprise.  She said her mother used to buy medication for other people in the community, and she pledged to continue the legacy that she had left. Daughter-in-law, Hellen Muguti said her late mother-in-law had dispelled the misconception exist between the relationship of the two. “My mother-in-law took me as her daughter, I was amazed with the level of trust she could put to me. Sometimes she could leave me in charge of the canteen, but what was surprising was that she never bothered to ascertain if the cash was short,” said Hellen. Elder son Killian, who is Zanu PF councillor for Mbare, said he was ushered into politics by her mother. He said he was taught on how to engage people in politics, adding that Gogo told her that politics was not dirty, but it was the people who came with bad ideas. “My mother is the one who invited me into politics, she told me that most of the people think politics is dirty, but it becomes so when dirty people come in. I was strengthened by her words,” said Killian. He said Gogo Samuriwo could use her church experience as a devout Catholic to counsel young people in this community, especially those whose future seemed bleak. “Gogo helped a lot of people, she was a counsellor, she provided counselling to a lot of people and most of them could have committed suicide by now. She rejuvenated and revived a lot of people’s hopes. “Due to her good works, Zanu PF members in Mufakose nominated Gogo to represent the people in elections. As children, we are very happy that the Government under the leadership of President Mnangagwa recognised our mother,” he said. “Gogo Samuriwo could dress like a mother. She loved her community as she bought a transformer, and renovated roads in this community that were neglected here, but she used her money to assist the community,” added Killian. Her nephew, Nigel Mutumha, said she was the best at mobilising party cadres. “She used to be a dedicated and loyal Zanu PF member who played a significant role in mobilising and recruitment of party members, especially in the grassroots,” said Nigel. A neighbour to Gogo Samuriwo, Mrs Veronica Kahari, described her as a loving mother who was deeply involved in community social work.  “I have known Gogo Samuriwo since 1979 after being introduced to her by her daughter, Vivian, who was my friend. She was a good person with motherly qualities. “She used to bring leftovers from her kitchen and distribute them to neighbours. At the time of her death, she was now concentrating on the vulnerable groups, the elderly and orphans,” said Mrs Kahari. “Sometimes she could give people food hampers, she was a very sociable and peaceloving mother. In times of need she could donate even the last cent she had. She looke after more than 13 children who were in need,” she said. One of her employees, Mrs Tracy Mukonomuvi, said she was deeply saddened by the loss of Gogo Samuriwo, adding she was a patriotic cadre who could preach the good works of the ruling Zanu PF party. “We are all in deep sorrow following the passing on of Gogo, she was a good person who would always encourage us to follow the principles of the revolutionary party Zanu PF. She was loving and showed her love to everyone, she met” said Mrs Mukonomuvi. A neighbour, Mrs Eunika Mutoti, echoed Gogo Samuriwo’s love for the community, adding she was happy mother who could accommodate everyone.  Gogo Samuriwo and the Ireland ruby team. “Even the dogs in this community will remember  Gogo as a good neighbour. This place was a place of everyone. We learnt to share from her because whatever she had; she could share. We don’t know how this wound is going to heal,” said Gogo Mutoti. Cde David Mutukwa who spoke from the political side said Gogo Samuriwo was a staunch supporter of Zanu PF who could assist in various political activities. “This house was used for political activities. People could gather in this house, and most of aspiring legislators representing the ruling party came through her and used even to gather her to improve ways of mobilising people. She assisted a lot of families in cash or kind,” he said. “She became a dedicated cadre and rose through structures to the provincial level in the ruling Zanu PF party. She was a provincial member for two terms responsible for legal affairs. This was before she came down to the district level as the head of the Women’s League for Mufakose District 3 for more than 25 years,” said Cde Mutukwa. A long-time employee, Sheillah Nhokwara, said they had more to cherish on Gogo Samuriwo as anemployer. “Gogo Samuriwo was a determined woman; she was someone who wanted to empower women. She wanted everyone to be self-dependent. He taught us a lot of things. I have been  this canteen for the past 16 years. Some people tried to influence me to quit the job, but I remained steadfast because I knew that Gogo had a unique personality,” said Sheillah. Gogo Samuriwo was laid to rest at her rural home in Chihota last Friday. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/show-some-love-on-mothers-day/,Show some love on Mother’s Day,"Laina Makuzha-LOVE by DESIGN “Despite the many cultural differences that exist and differing expectations of motherhood throughout history and the world, one thing remains constant: a recognition that mothers have a uniquely important, valuable role in helping children to thrive,” those wise words from Christine Gross-Loh, author of “Parenting Without Borders: Surprising Lessons Parents Around the World Can Teach Us” — ring true to this day. Tomorrow is Mother’s Day. A worthy commemoration in my view.  I see Mother’s Day as a special occasion and opportunity to pause from our ever busy lives and hustles, to express our love, gratitude, and admiration more deliberately, for the incredible women who have shaped our lives.  Whether they are biological mothers, grandmothers, aunts, guardians, sisters, or mentors, colleagues, those from church — pastor or pastor’s wife, these remarkable individuals deserve our heartfelt appreciation.  This week we take a moment to remind ourselves of the significance of, and share thoughts on how to foster love within our homes.  Contrary to popular belief that only women are celebrated and focussed on, we do have Father’s Day following hard on the heels of Mother’s Day, on the third Sunday of next month.  So we get to honour and celebrate the fathers that have directed and shaped our lives, next month.  Be ready.  Just thought I’d throw that in there, lest we forget. Motherhood really extends beyond biological ties. It encompasses the nurturing love and care provided by sisters, colleagues, church mates, and even pastors’ wives. Honouring all mother figures beyond biology, is a wonderful way to recognise the value every woman can have in nurturing society, not necessarily through biological parenting but the heart and willingness to impart good values in others that comes naturally to some.  Society can recognise and celebrate all those who play a maternal role in one’s life. Their impact is phenomenal and immeasurable. Acts of kindness On Mother’s Day, everyone can choose to participate. Perhaps you’ve been there for your mother, aunt or someone whose impact in your life was that of a mother. Pick up the phone and make that call, or better still visit if you can.  If there’s been tension, this is a good time to bury the hatchet, turn a new leaf and mend those relationships. You can visit an old people’s home to honour the mothers and grandmothers there whom society might have forgotten.  Spend time, cheer them up, do something — maybe cook for them, offer some appropriate recreation or support in any way you can, even if it’s just by your presence.  If you’re a husband, consider these ways to honour your wife in addition to gifts you may have in mind: Improved communication: Think of the things she has complained about in your relationship. Commit to being better.  Listen actively and with understanding and express your feelings openly too, to improve your bond. Encourage children (though usually they hardly need cranking), to honour their mother and be kind to her.  Shared Responsibilities: If you haven’t been actively supporting your wife, now is a good time to change.  Share household responsibilities and show appreciation for her efforts. Also share the important vision and dreams you have as individuals. You are not alone in that marriage.  Too many couples vanoita “mazvake-mazvake” for example in the area of finances.  I suggest kuita zvinhu zvenyu together as a couple  because a house divided against itself cannot stand.  Mothers celebrating themselves and one another And to all my sisters, mothers from all walks of life, it’s your day: don’t wait to be spoiled!  This day is about celebrating you, what God invested in you. You can make the day special for those around you too, or encourage a fellow mother. And whether your own mother is alive or not, there’s much to cherish and do in her honour.   Here are some ideas to honour mothers: Cook a special meal: Prepare a beautiful meal for your family as they celebrate you with you. Food shared with love nourishes not only the body but also the soul and it sets a beautiful atmosphere for bonding. Acts of kindness: Extend your love beyond your family, share a meal with friends or neighbours if you feel the need to do so.  Perform acts of kindness for those who don’t have a mother figure in their lives. You might know a lonely elderly woman who lives alone, spare a thought or reach out if you can. A biblical perspective Proverbs: 31 describes the virtuous woman, a wife and mother who embodies strength, wisdom, and compassion.  Her actions inspire us to foster love within our homes. Husbands can learn from her example and honour their wives by appreciating their tireless efforts. Just think of all the things she stands for, the role she plays day in, day out, it can be cumbersome. It is therefore befitting to let her know she is truly appreciated. Ultimately, Mother’s Day is a reminder to cherish the women who have shaped us.  Let’s celebrate all mothers — biological and otherwise — for their unwavering love, sacrifice, and nurturing spirit. As we honour them, we are aware no one is perfect, so let’s also reflect on the transformative power of love and kindness we can extend towards them.  So, till next edition, Happy Mother’s Day to every remarkable woman out there!  Receive your flowers.  Happy Mother’s Day too, to everyone born of a mother and thank God for them, alive or not. Their love, and sacrifice can never be forgotten, you are their legacy.  Let’s keep the conversation going. I do know, a day like this can be difficult for some whose mothers are no longer with us. I can relate, having lost my own mother very painfully in 2013.  So you are welcome to express your thoughts, experiences and great memories of departed mothers, your own motherhood experience or if you are just needing ways to go through the day.

https://www.herald.co.zw/mothers-day-traditions-around-the-world/,Mother’s Day traditions around the world,"There are a lot of holidays throughout the year, but there’s only one Mother’s Day. Landing tomorrow, don’t forget to let that all-important woman in your life know just how much she means to you and how thankful you are for all she does. From lending an ear when you need someone to listen to doling out that one-of-a-kind mom advice, it’s a mother that seems to always know just the right thing to say and do. To celebrate her in style, we have gathered a list of Mother’s Day activities to do with your mom, stepmom, grandmother, aunt, wife, daughter, friend or anyone else you’re honouring this year. However, a lot has been written and said about this day but what are some of the traditions across the world. In honour of Mother’s Day, we set out to discover how different cultures across the globe celebrate moms. In many US, households, the second Sunday in May begins with breakfast in bed, a bouquet of flowers, homemade cards, and other tokens of affection for mom.  Mother’s Day in the US has been an official holiday since 1914. In other corners of the globe, honouring Mom is a rite grounded in local traditions and customs — some ancient, some surprisingly new. “Most cultures celebrate mothers because they are traditionally the main caregiver, which comes with great responsibility,” says Mei-Ling Hopgood, author of How Eskimos Keep Their Babies Warm: And Other Adventures in Parenting. Here, we take you on a quick trip around the world to discover how moms in five different countries are celebrated and to provide some inspiration for your own day. Share our “bring it home” ideas with your family. India: 10-Day Festival In the fall, Hindus honour the goddess Durga during the 10-day festival known as Durga Puja. The celebration is thought to date back to the sixteenth century and is considered both a religious ceremony and a time for family reunions. One story tells of Durga returning to her parents’ home to show off her own children. Families spend weeks preparing food, gathering gifts, and decorating their homes for the festival. Bring it home: Visit other moms you know, among both friends and family, and bring home-cooked goods to share. Japan: The Right Flowers Mother’s Day is celebrated in Japan on the second Sunday in May, as in the United States. The traditional gift is carnations.  Bring it home: Thank the moms in your community who help your family by writing notes of gratitude. Tie the notes to carnations and leave the flowers on the moms’ doorsteps. Ethiopia: Sing Along! The Antrosht festival, observed at the end of the rainy season in early fall, is dedicated to moms. After the weather clears for good, family members from all over flock to their homes for a large meal and celebration. Daughters traditionally bring vegetables and cheese, while sons supply meat. Together, they prepare a meat hash and sing and perform dances that tell stories of family heroes. Bring it home: Share stories about all the women in your family. Go through your photo albums together and create a personal scrapbook of those special moms who’ve come before you. United Kingdom: A Church Custom Mothering Sunday” falls on the fourth Sunday of Lent. Back in the 1700s, the day was marked by young house servants returning home to spend time with their mothers. That custom evolved from an earlier one in which families who had moved away would return to the original church they attended. Today, the holiday remains grounded in religion, with many churches handing out daffodils for children to give to Mom. Traditionally, girls also bake a fruitcake for their mothers. Bring it home: Ask your family to celebrate you on Mother’s Day by launching a new tradition based on one from your own childhood. France: Medals for Mom In 1920, the government of France began awarding medals to mothers of large families in gratitude for helping rebuild the population after so many lives were lost in World War I. After the second World War, the government declared the last Sunday in May to be the Day of Mothers. The traditional gift is now a flower-shaped cake. Bring it home: Awarding medals for bringing children into the world is obviously outdated, but expressing gratitude never goes out of style  — especially when you’re demonstrating ways to express it to your children. Share your thankfulness for each family member at dinner and ask them each to do the same. — today.com/history.com "
https://www.herald.co.zw/quality-over-quantity-the-key-to-sustainable-change/,Quality over quantity: The key to sustainable change,"Coach Kelly-Fitness Correspondent This week, we delve into the world of habit formation and achieving results.  Often, the focus falls on sheer quantity — doing more reps at the gym, eating countless salads, or working endless hours.  But what if the secret lies in form? Here’s why prioritising quality over quantity might be the key to unlocking sustainable change: Lifestyle Integration: Small, well-formed habits are easier to integrate into your everyday life.  Think of a brisk 20-minute walk or a short, effective gym session you can fit into your routine. Consistency is vital for long-term success. Influence and Peer Pressure: Imagine a friend effortlessly maintaining a healthy weight through mindful eating choices versus someone constantly on restrictive diets.  The friend with good form inspires positive change through a more sustainable approach. Changing Behaviour: Sustainable change comes from understanding the “why” behind your actions.  Focusing on form allows you to explore healthier choices and build intrinsic motivation, leading to long-term behavioural shifts. What You Eat: A single, well-balanced meal packed with nutrients is more beneficial than mindlessly filling your plate with low-quality food. Quality trumps quantity when it comes to nourishing your body. Workplace Arrangements: Prioritising focused work sessions over long, unproductive hours can lead to better results. Creating a work environment that promotes well-being and efficiency fosters sustainable performance. Get Active, Your Way! Regular exercise is crucial for overall health and well-being.  Consider incorporating movement you enjoy into your routine.  Here is a work out routine you can follow for a week: Monday: Strength Training Superset 1: Exercise 1: Goblet squat: 12 reps Exercise 2: Lat pull-down or pull-up (you can use the machine or a resistance band): 12 reps for lat pull-down or five reps for pull-up Do four sets Superset 2: Exercise 1: Step-up: 10 reps each leg (to make this more challenging, hold two five- to 10-pound dumbbells by your sides.)

https://www.herald.co.zw/chioma-umeala-pushes-for-more-diversity-in-anime/,Chioma Umeala pushes for more diversity in animé,"Masego Seemela-Youth Interactive Correspondent The “Woman King” star Chioma Umeala is driven by closing the gap in terms of representation for black women in the world of animé. The young actor is known for her performance in Netflix’s popular live-action adaptation of the manga series, “One Piece”, slipping into character as feisty Nojiko.  This weekend she will take to the main stage at Comic Con Africa in Cape Town, joining a panel discussion that delves deeper into the process and experience of making the series.  “I’m seizing this opportunity as a way to bring in more diversity. Yes, it’s a nerd convention but I believe the narrative has changed where we think a ‘nerd’ is a white man with glasses. Some of us don’t look like that but we like animé, hence it’s importance to show our faces in such a medium,” she said. “Black people are commonly known to be the last ones on the screen.  With us showing our interest in such a medium, we stand a better chance of dominating these spaces.”  Umeala got a life-changing experience acting alongside Oscar winner Viola Davis and Mzansi’s very own Thuso Mbedu in “The Woman King” in 2022. “I have always been a fan of storytelling since I was quite young. I love stories being told in any medium, be it podcasts, film, television or theatre. Animé is just that in another medium,” she said. “Often people think that animé is a genre or division but it can be split into many things. There are different ranges, from comedy to drama or horror.  “The reason why we tend to resonate with cartoons more is that it allows us to explore worlds beyond our imagination. It allows us to take storytelling to another dimension.” Umeala recalled growing up on the comic series Supa Strikas and being a die-hard fan of “Dragon Ball Z”.  “My nickname is Gigi, who is Goku’s wife; having such a childhood where you see animé exist in your world meant quite a lot to me as a child hence I’d love that for the younger generation, specifically young black girls,” she said.  The half-Nigerian and half-South African performer, who got her breakout role in daily drama “Isono”, takes pride in her multi-cultural identity and heritage. “From my generation, even younger, there’s no fighting the reality that we are a mixed nationality. We also have people from many different African countries living here and are spread across the world. I’ve always known that I am a product of two people from two different countries who created me,” she said.  “I am one of many variations who are like me. I know so many half-Nigerians and -Xhosa or half-Nigerian and-Pedi but we are culturally South Africans.  “So, instead of fighting that reality, I want to be a representation of how enriching it is to come from diversity within our diaspora.” Umeala encouraged Africans to embrace their uniqueness through storytelling, which she described as a superpower.  “As Africans, we don’t all speak in the same accent or even eat the same food. So, with us showcasing who we are from our different cultures, we are giving the world a culturally enriching experience and not just one dimension of all Africans,” she said.  “We’re a big continent and our stories are yet to be told through the vast mediums at our disposal. We need to dominate these forms of storytelling.” "
https://www.herald.co.zw/every-student-was-born-out-of-a-mother/,Every student was born out of a mother,"Latwell Nyangu-Youth Interactive Writer Students often find themselves reflecting on the impact their mothers have had on their lives. From the early years of childhood to adulthood, mothers play a crucial role in shaping their children’s values, beliefs, and behaviours. As students grow and mature, they begin to appreciate the sacrifices, love, and guidance that their mothers have provided throughout their lives. To the most amazing mothers, Happy Mother’s Day! Your kindness, strength, and guidance have made us who we are today. This week I bring a word of appreciation to our mothers. I understand some of us haven’t had the love of our mothers. Some didn’t even have an opportunity to see their mothers. There are however some who have rogue mothers, while some are blessed to have good mothers. May those who haven’t had their Mothers love, find comfort from the Lord and those who care for them. At times when I write I also understand some scenarios and situations which some of us go through on a daily basis. But it shall be well. Tomorrow is a day to celebrate Mother’s Day. As students, you come from different backgrounds and today we acknowledge biological mothers, stepmothers, foster mothers, surrogate mothers, single mothers, working moms, military moms, and other mothers, through relations or associations. Their job is still tireless and often thankless. When it is done right, the job is still about unconditional love, even when that means showing tough love. Many times, if we don’t make a point to intentionally and fully express our gratitude to our mothers regularly or at least once a year, we run the risk of forgetting to appreciate one of the most fundamental truths about our lives; that we only exist because of our mothers. It remains a lifelong commitment. Even after a child matures, graduates, and is gainfully employed, they will still look up to their mothers. I have noticed that some students go astray due to a lack of mother’s love, and in such cases they tend not to care. Some abscond from lectures because they have no support from their mothers. Some end up quitting school when they don’t have mothers. In most cases, the first person to be blamed for children’s failures is often the mother. If an adult child weds or even procreates, the mother continues to look after her grandchildren. They cut the umbilical cord at birth, but there are other bonds that stay intact. Mothers are the glue that holds our lives together. They coddled and cuddled us when we could do nothing for ourselves.  As we grew, they were our nurses, doctors, dieticians, and psychologists. They taught us, protected us, preached to us, guided and guarded us, they were uncanny human lie detectors and untiring sounding boards. Mothers laughed at our jokes, no matter how corny they were, and cried with us when our hearts were breaking. When we are in trouble, our mothers feed us and clothe us. Mothers are many individuals rolled into one. When we go back to college, mothers remain on our backs to make sure we are well catered for. Mostly when students have issues, they first address them to their mothers before taking them to their fathers. If you delay going home, mothers are the first to check on you as students. So, for Mother’s Day, we have a few special wishes for the mothers out there — any age, any stage of life, and with any prefix or modifier in front of the word mother. As students’ progress through academic journey, and face challenges along the way, they start to recognize the valuable lessons that their mothers have imparted to them. Whether it’s teaching them the importance of hard work, resilience in the face of adversity, or kindness towards others, students come to appreciate the wisdom and guidance that their mothers have shared with them. These lessons shape students’ character and influence how they navigate the complexities of life. I hope you are going to make your mother feel special on this day. As students reach milestones such as graduation or embark on new adventures in college or careers, they often take a moment to reflect on the unwavering support and encouragement they have received from their mothers. Gratitude fills their hearts as they realise the sacrifices made by their mothers to ensure they have a bright future ahead. Students express appreciation for the countless hours spent helping with homework, attending parent-teacher conferences, and providing emotional support during challenging times. Mother’s Day is a celebration honouring the mother of the family or individual, as well as motherhood, maternal bonds, and the influence of mothers in society. It is celebrated on different days in many parts of the world, most commonly in March or May. Let’s send a very heartfelt Happy Mother’s Day to all the moms out there. On a typical morning, we wake up with a whole reality waiting for us. Before the day passes us by, pick up the phone or say a silent prayer letting her know how much you appreciate the greatest gift you could ever receive Flowers would be nice. Take them out, pay the bills. Until we meet for a toast, let’s love our mothers Feedback: [email protected] "
https://www.herald.co.zw/wake-up-work-hard-make-your-dreams-a-reality/,"‘Wake up, work hard, make your dreams a reality’","Primrose Chibharo-Harare High School student From May 1-3, 2024, I had the privilege of being among the five Harare High learners, along with pupils from other schools, to attend the Dream Big Conference hosted by the International Youth Fellowship (IYF) in partnership with the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education.  The conference was held at the Harare Girls High School.  We met various speakers who encouraged us to wake up, work hard and make our dreams a reality. Pastor Yang Kyeong Chan, the IYF country director, started his presentation by asking us, “What is your dream?”  This made everyone wonder what their dream was.  He encouraged us by using the story of the Wright Brothers, who had a dream to see a flying machine. They didn’t just dream about it; they invented one.  They made their dream a reality, which is why we are talking about them today.  From this story, I learned that unless you work hard, you will never attain what you want in life.  He concluded his presentation by giving us the recipe for success: capital (money), good people, and a good market or environment. Miriam Jani, an executive producer at ZBC, encouraged us to work hands-on to gain experience in what we want to accomplish in life.  For example, when you want to work in a medical field, a student can consider going to a nearby clinic and volunteer their services to gain experience.  She encouraged us to research more on what we want to be, so as to gain clarity on what we will become in the future. Local actor cum producer Zolile Makeleni talked about how we should cherish education as it is a privilege, not a right.  He said it was a privilege because not everyone could afford education. He mentioned that failing to dream is a disease, and every leaner  should have a dream, at least to have a good life or something beyond that. He said that the reason why most students failed was because they felt entitled to everything life offers, thereby killing their dreams.  During his presentation, he played a song by Winky D titled “Daddy.”  The song talks about a child who asks his parents what they are doing while other fathers are buying houses and companies and waking up early in the morning for work.  From that song, I was motivated to work hard so that my children will not ask me such thought-provoking questions.  He concluded his presentation by giving us the power of association, which encouraged us to always reflect on who we spend our time with, adding that our dreams are nurtured by those around us. The guest speaker of the conference was Dr Prof Choi Jong Eun, a mind education specialist (IMEI) from South Korea, who spoke about value.  He presented a picture of a key and said, “No matter how old the key gets, it always has value.”  “If there is a lock, the key holds great value.” From this, I learned that everyone has great value, and students should have a key to their discovery.  He also told us a story of a child who was autistic whose parents treated him like a disabled person. They would actually tell everyone that their child was disabled.  One day, the parents met a prophet who convinced them that their child was just like every other child, and he also made them promise to never treat him like he was disabled. From this example, he made us aware that different thinking produces different outcomes, meaning that if one thinks negatively, negativity is produced; therefore, we should always be positive.  He concluded by saying that the people, environment, and mindset determine the outcomes of our lives. The biggest lesson I would love to tell everyone is to dream big, aim high, and strive for success, and above all, to never give up.  Special thanks to Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, Honourable Torerayi Moyo, pastor Yang Kyeong Chan and Prof Jae Yun Shim, IYF chairman for Southern Africa, and all stakeholders for making this event a success and ensuring that every learner does not give up on their dreams.

https://www.herald.co.zw/miss-teen-usa-srivastava-relinquishes-title/,Miss Teen USA Srivastava relinquishes title,"UmaSofia Srivastava, who took home the 2023 title in September, shared a lengthy statement on Wednesday announcing her departure because her “personal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organisation.” “After months of grappling with the decision, I have made the choice to resign from the title of Miss Teen USA 2023. I am grateful for all the support from my family, my state directors, my sister queens, and the fans who have cheered me on since I won my state title,” Srivastava wrote.  “I will always look back on my time as Miss NJ Teen USA fondly, and the experience of representing my state as a first generation, Mexican-Indian American at the national level was fulfilling in itself.” In a statement shared with USA TODAY on Wednesday, Miss USA CEO and president Laylah Rose said, “Our all-encompassing goal at Miss USA is to celebrate and empower women. Our participants make a real difference in this country and around the globe.” Rose’s statement continued, “All along, my personal goal as the head of this organisation has been to inspire women to always create new dreams, have the courage to explore it all, and continue to preserve integrity along the way. I hold myself to these same high standards and I take these allegations seriously. Please be assured that the well-being of all individuals associated with Miss USA is my top priority.” In her resignation statement, Srivastava vowed to continue her philanthropy work with The Lotus Pedal Foundation and the Bridge of Books Foundation as she completes her junior year of high school. “While this was certainly not how I saw my reign coming to a close, I am excited to continue my advocacy for education and acceptance, start applying to colleges, and share some exciting new projects on  “That’s Fan Behaviour with those of you who plan to stick around,” she captioned the post, referring to her blog. Srivastava added: “At the end of the day, I am so lucky to have had the privilege of this experience, but if this is just a chapter, I know that the story of my life will truly be incredible.” “I LOVE YOU! So proud of you my angel,” former Miss USA Voigt commented.  On Monday, Voigt, who was awarded Miss USA in September 2023, announced her resignation in a statement on Instagram. The former title holder wrote, “In life, I strongly value the importance of making decisions that feel best for you and your mental health.” Her decision to relinquish her Miss USA crown has sparked a flurry of online speculation after fans noticed a strange detail about her statement. In the comments of her post and elsewhere on social media, users pieced the first letter in each sentence of her statement to reveal the phrase “I AM SILENCED” — though this discounts the last three sentences, the first letters of which spell “HIP.” It was not immediately clear whether the message was intentional. Miss USA previously said in a statement to USA TODAY, “We respect and support former Miss USA Noelia Voigt’s decision to step down from her duties. The well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritise herself at this time.” The statement added, “The organisation is currently reviewing plans for the transition of responsibilities to a successor and an announcement regarding the crowning of the new Miss USA will be coming soon.” Prior to Voigt’s announcement, Miss USA social media director Claudia Michelle shared on Instagram Friday that she has resigned from her role. In a statement posted to social media, she wrote, “I have had the privilege of getting to work with Noelia closely and have unfortunately seen a decline in her mental health since we (first) met. I feel like her ability to share her story and her platform have been diminished.” “I feel the way current management speaks about their titleholders is unprofessional and inappropriate,” she went on to write. “I disavow workplace toxicity and bullying of any kind.” – USTODAY "
