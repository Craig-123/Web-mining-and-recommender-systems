Slot, who is currently managing Feyenoord, has a reputation for nurturing young talent, making him an ideal successor to Klopp, who has successfully integrated several academy players into his team. This season, a significant number of Liverpool’s emerging stars have been sent out on loan – 20 in total. Not all are ready for first-team action just yet, but many will be hoping to impress Slot when he takes the reins at Anfield. Here’s how each of Liverpool’s 20 loanees have performed this season, according to Mirror Football. Calvin Ramsay Ramsay joined Liverpool amid high expectations in the summer of 2022, but his two loan spells this season at Preston North End and Bolton Wanderers have been disappointing. The Scottish player has struggled to make his mark at either club, suggesting that another loan spell may be necessary before he’s ready for Liverpool’s first team. Rhys Williams Williams’ season has been far from successful, with the defender seeing more action for Liverpool’s Under-23s than during his loan spell at Aberdeen. In fact, the 23 year old rarely made it onto the bench for the Dons, indicating that he’s some distance away from securing a place in Liverpool’s first team. Fabio Carvalho Carvalho kicked off the season at RB Leipzig, but was primarily used as a super sub by the Bundesliga squad. After his relationship with Leipzig soured, he was shipped out to Hull, where he shone in their play-off push. Despite falling just short, the Portuguese international stands a good chance of being promoted to Liverpool’s first team in the new season. Harvey Davies Davies spent a large part of the season as Crewe’s go-to keeper, but has been dropped from their squad entirely during the final stretch. Although Caominhin Kelleher is expected to be sold this summer, Davies needs another season on loan before he can be considered as a potential back-up for Alisson. Owen Beck Beck, who has been a standout performer for Dundee, is one of Liverpool’s most impressive loanees. Before an injury sidelined him in March, Beck had been a regular starter for the Scottish side, scoring twice and providing four assists in 28 appearances, helping them secure a top-half finish. With doubts over Kostas Tsimikas’ quality, Beck is a prime candidate for a first-team call-up. Sepp van den Berg Van den Berg has been one of the few bright spots in a dismal season for Mainz. The 05ers have been fighting relegation all season, with Van den Berg sitting out just one match. With Liverpool’s defence set for a revamp this summer, he could be asked to step up. Anderson Arroyo It seems unlikely that Arroyo will ever become a regular for Liverpool. The 24 year old has been a starter for Spanish second-tier side Burgos this season, but with Conor Bradley emerging as Trent Alexander-Arnold’s top back-up at right-back, a sale this summer seems probable. James Balagizi This season has been a let down for Balagizi, with the 20 year old struggling to make his mark on loan at either Wigan or Kilmarnock. The midfielder has only made 13 appearances in total this term and another loan move this summer seems to be his best bet. Dominic Corness Corness has had a successful campaign at Yvderon-Sport in the Swiss Super League, helping them likely avoid relegation. The midfielder has made 21 appearances in all competitions, though another loan move would probably be best for the 21 year old. Adam Lewis Lewis has had a mixed season on loan at Newport County, having several spells out of a team which endured a disappointing year in League Two. This was his second spell at Rodney Parade and a permanent move to an EFL team appears to be his most likely move this summer. Jakub Ojrzynski Another young Red who has had mixed fortunes out on loan is Ojrzynski, with the Polish keeper spending much of the season as back-up at Dutch second-tier side Den Bosch. He will need regular game-time on loan next season if he is to convince his parent club that he has a future at Anfield. Billy Koumetio Koumetio will be eager to put this season behind him as swiftly as possible. Initially, he was loaned out to Dunkerque, but a disagreement led to his return to Anfield. The defender was then dispatched to Blackburn Rovers, but he didn’t manage to make an appearance for the Championship team. It’s unlikely that Slot will call him up this summer. Luke Hewitson The 19 year old has had a successful season with Stalybridge Celtic. The non-league side were so impressed that they extended his loan in January, and another move seems likely for Hewitson this summer. James Norris Despite a challenging start to the season, Norris finished the campaign as Tranmere’s starting left-back. With Rovers finishing mid-table in League Two, another loan move would be best for the 21 year old’s development. Tyler Morton Morton has been the star of Hull’s bid for a play-off place in the Championship and seems to be the most likely to receive a call from Slot. He scored three goals and provided five assists in 41 appearances for the Tigers, as well as shining on the international stage for England’s Under-21s. Slot is likely looking forward to working with the young talent. Nat Phillips After a tough stint at Celtic, Phillips has found success at Preston. He has made 18 appearances for North End and has proven to be a reliable senior option. However, with his contract expiring in 12 months and the Englishman keen to get more game time, it might be the right time to sell. Luca Stephenson Stephenson proved to be a valuable asset for Barrow this season, despite not contributing any goals or assists. His team narrowly missed out on the play-offs in the third tier and another loan move would likely be the best option for him to secure a regular position. – liverpoolecho.co.uk      "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/antipas-sings-donovan-praises/,Antipas sings Donovan praises,"Innocent Kurira, [email protected] CHICKEN Inn coach Joey Antipas says goalkeeper Donovan Bernard will be missed if he makes a move away from the club. This comes after his heroic exploits that saw him save Chicken Inn from what looked to be a defeat against Bulawayo Chiefs at the weekend. The match ended nil-all thanks to Bernard. Bernard saved a Never Rauzhi penalty kick before going on to make other point blank saves which proved why he is the country’s number one. Antipas had nothing but nice words for his shotstopper. “Donovan is a great keeper. To have him in our side is great news. He is keeping clean sheets and for us it’s a great boost. If he has to go we will miss him. We will certainly miss Donovan if he does go,” said Antipas. Already, South Africa’s Supersport United chief scout, Paul Matthews has been in the country to assess Bernard. Matthews was in the company of one of the country’s renowned player agents, Gibson Mahachi when Chicken Inn played host to Dynamos. The goalkeeper is set to go through further assessment when Zimbabwe play their World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa next month. The Warriors’ fixtures against Lesotho and South Africa will be played across the Limpopo River, since Zimbabwe is still without a stadium certified to play host to international matches. Rufaro Stadium is still being renovated and even struggled to get the Zifa First Instance Board (FIB)’s approval for the hosting of Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches Interestingly, earlier on this year, Supersport United, who are fondly known as Matsatsantsa aPitori, invited Dynamos goalminder Martin Mapisa for a brief trial stint. Supersport United provides home to ex-Warriors duo of Washington Arubi and Onismor Bhasera. The club once had Kudakwashe Mahachi, the late imposing Warriors goalkeeper George Chigova and Terrence Dzukamanja in their books.—@innocentskizoe "

Named after the late Vice President, Landa J. Nkomo, the schools officials and learners expressed excitement to receive the generous donation, which goes a long way in capacitating the institution’s sporting performance. The expressed gratitude to Mr Nkomo for assisting them saying sport was a serious component of the new curriculum. The colorful sports kits, were presented to the excited students during a special ceremony at the school grounds where Mr Nkomo spoke passionately about his father’s love for education and sports, emphasizing the importance of both in shaping young minds and building a strong community.  Mr Nkomo, who is based in America, following in his father’s footsteps of generosity and kindness said the gesture meant so much to his family. “We came together as family and friends to ensure that our father’s legacy continues. I have a strong sports history and that is why I chose to donate sports equipment,” he said. “We also want to ensure that the school introduces other sporting activities that are not offered at the school such as basketball and cricket. This is also to ensure the children are occupied and do not get involved in delinquent behaviour,” said Mr Nkomo.  He said the act of kindness has a ripple effect, and hoped that it will inspire others to give back and make a positive impact in their own communities. “The spirit of giving and community unity is alive and well. The legacy of our father will live on and hope to see it inspire generations to come,” said Mr Nkomo. The learners cheered and clapped as they tried on their new uniforms, feeling a sense of pride and unity in representing their school on the sports field. Mr Nkomo said the impact of his donation will be felt for years to come, inspiring the next generation to strive for excellence both academically and athletically. “As the children embark on their sporting journey I want them to feel a strong connection to a man who dedicated his life to serving his community and building a brighter future for all,” said Mr Nkomo.

https://www.chronicle.co.zw/watch-quick-flashes-dazzle-bosso/,WATCH: Quick flashes dazzle Bosso,"Nkosilathi Sibanda at Barbourfields Stadium  Highlanders 0-2 FC Platinum THE glory that laced Highlanders’ good start to the Castle Lager Premiership was dented as they succumbed to a two-nil loss against visiting FC Platinum at Barbourfields yesterday. Early goals by FC Platinum, that came in a quick flash inside 10 minutes was all that separated the two teams. FC Platinum opened the nets in two minutes of play through Juan Mutudza, who well positioned himself to finish off a co-ordinated play. Highlanders rear guard was caught off guard and exposed their goalkeeper Raphael Pitisi, who dived the wrong way and let in a beauty of a shot. Inside the five minutes, Highlanders tried to raid upfront, making fast paces but the visitors’ defence was alert, marking close man-to-man, shutting out the efforts.  FC Platinum had the first corner, just in 10 minutes of play, Mutudza curled it and Lawrence Mhlanga rose high and nodded the second goal. It was two-nil.  Highlanders were not in their usual form. That trusted defensive line led by captain Peter Muduhwa was porous. The goalie was out of sorts in as much as he needed that rear cover. After the second goal, Bosso attempted to regain composure and there was Mvelo Khoza with a thunderbolt that however, went wide. Godfrey Makaruse, who was drafted in to replace Archford Faira, was tackled on his attack in the left lank by Hagiazo Magaya. It was a foul. Mbeba took the kick and skied it.  Bosso’s first corner came in the 30th minute. Prince Ndlovu took the task and got no takers at goal. Another corner kick came and Andrew Mbeba was trusted to pass it through, instead, the ball was blocked by Platinum’ Rainsome Pavari. In that first stanza, Bosso’s midfield failed to create and maintain play. FC Platinum read the match so well and saw that Bosso had a huge lapse in the middle of the park, so much that they made a good advantage of blocking Highlanders’ best offensive moves, in the crosses, coming off the flanks.  The absence of the ever creative Melikhaya Ncube was felt. Ncube was serving a yellow card suspension. At the 37th minute, Bosso had the chance to reply as McKinnon Mushore’s shot hit the upright post with the rebound landing on Prince Ndlovu’s boots, who let it wide and made the fans sigh in disbelief of a moment they saw as a redemption. However, it wasn’t to be. FC Platinum had their second and third corners at 39 minutes taken by Panashe Mutimbanyoka. They yielded nothing. A forth corner cane their way in the 43rd minute. The whistle was blown to end the first-half. All was well for the Norman Mapeza-coached side. In the opening 15 minutes of the second-, Highlanders will rue the chances they missed, they could have got the consolation and even levelled matters. Lynoth Chikuhwa had a near miss as he hit the ball to the far post. It was another opportunity for recovery. Showing off their Pure Platinum Play, the visitors could have netted their third goal through Hagiazo Magaya. Both teams made changes in bringing in substitutes. FC Platinum were the first as they made a double substitution in 61 minutes when Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya came for Wilfred Muvirimi and Oscar Bhebhe for Davison Murowa. Bosso, reeling under pressure, in the 66th minute brought Marvellous Chigumira, resting Mvelo Khoza. Calvin Chigonero came in for Devine Mhindirira. The losing side also brought in Talent Dube to replace Godfrey Makaruse in the 79th minute. At the stroke of full time, in the 83rd minute, Mapeza made another change. Brighton Manhire replaced Shephard Mhlanga. Kelvin Mangiza was off for Mutudza.  For FC Platinum, the fresh legs could have been to cement the lead they enjoyed so well while for Highlanders coach Kelvin Kaindu it was a desperate search for goals that were elusive. It felt bad for Kaindu and he was in pain for not having Melikhaya on the fold. He admitted his side wasn’t on point yesterday. It was Highlanders’ second loss in the campaign. Kaindu made a reference to Melikhaya Ncube’s absence which he said affected the team. “We were unsettled in the first 10 minutes that we conceded two goals and it is always difficult to come back, especially against a team like FC Platinum. I think Melikhaya’s absence probably affected us. “We didn’t convert chances that came our way. Our opponents scored the chances they got. What happened was failure to convert the numerous chances that we had. Even in the second-half we looked a  stronger side but unfortunately we couldn’t get the goals from the chances we created.  FC Platinum coach, Norman Mapeza was a happy man and heaped praises on his charges. He, however, said he didn’t expect the victory given Bosso’s legacy at Barbourfields and their record so far. – @NkosieLegend.      "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/drama-as-schoolboys-hold-dynamos/,Drama as Schoolboys hold Dynamos,"Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau Dynamos 1-1 Herentals MATCH officials hogged the limelight as low-key Castle Lager Premiership Harare derby between Dynamos and Herentals ended in a controversial draw at Rufaro yesterday. Far side assistant referee Kudzanai Hiya, who flagged Herentals’ Dreamer Liyeto opener for offside with 27 minutes on the clock, again raised his flag when Donald Dzvinyai appeared to have secured the points for Dynamos. With DeMbare players sprinting to celebrate and later confront Hiya, Herentals quickly started play and as they were going clear of goal, the Dynamos bench, led by goalkeepers’ coach Britto Gwere rushed into the pitch to curtail the attack. Apart from the controversy of disallowed goals, the “dirty” match was characterised by crude tackles and every aspect of tension.  After missing an array of chances in the opening half hour, Nomore Chinyerere broke the ice with a fortuitous finish, benefiting largely from poor goalkeeping by Takudzwa Chikosi, who fumbled the tame effort letting it slide in between his legs with 31 minutes played. With the Glamour Boys tiding things up to the break, they had no answers to the Students raids with substitute Milton Chimedza coming to the end of Tino Benza’s cross after 66 minutes. Dynamos gaffer Genesis Mangombe decried his team’s failure to utilise their opportunities. “We should try and make sure that we score goals whenever we get chances. I think we got so many chances in the first-half but we failed to score,” said Mangombe. “Some of these decisions are costing us at the end of the day but I am not a referee. “If it’s a goal, it’s a goal. Even in their (Herentals) goal, I thought there was an infringement on Jalai (Emmanuel). We scored a clear goal but it was disallowed.” His Herentals counterpart Paul Benza said he was not qualified to comment about match officiating although Liyeto’s first-half goal appeared to be legitimate. “I don’t qualify to comment about match officials,” said Benza.    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/boxing-and-wrestling-control-act-falls-short/,Boxing and Wrestling Control Act falls short,"Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Writer THE present Zimbabwe Boxing and Wrestling Control Act (Chapter 25:02) is reportedly outdated and is not aligned with the Constitution of Zimbabwe Amendment (No. 20) Act. 2013, amid revelations that it does not provide for participation for all including women and people with disabilities among other challenges.  The revelations were made by Zimbabwe National Boxing and Wrestling Control Board (ZNBWCB) acting chief executive officer Priscilla Kadungure, a key figure in the day-to-day running of professional boxing in the country. ZNBWCB was established through the Zimbabwe Boxing and Wrestling Control Act Chapter 25:02 of 1956. The objects of the Board are to regulate, control and exercise general supervision over boxing or wrestling at tournaments in Zimbabwe with a view to the elimination of undesirable practices and the protection of the interests of boxers, wrestlers, promoters, officials and the public generally. According to the Boxing and Wrestling Control legislature, which was enacted in 1963, female boxers are not recognised and it had to take the efforts of the board back in the late 1980s to convince the Sports Ministry to allow women to participate in professional boxing. Kudungure said the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act now fails to provide for: “effective professional combat sport dispute resolution mechanisms, participation for all including women and people with disabilities, marketing mechanisms for combat sport and integrated system for smooth transition from amateur to professional combat sports.”  As if that is not enough, Kadungure revealed that the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act (Chapter25: 02) has been found wanting as it also fails to provide for the recognition and reward of outstanding combat sport persons, managers, promoters, trainers, organisations and associations through a national awards system, protection from exploitation, protection of all combat sport persons, managers, trainers, promoters and officials, establishment and maintenance of cordial relations with regional, continental and international combat sport bodies. Zimbabwe Boxing Federation (ZBF) technical director Stephen Masiyambumbi said there was a need to revise the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act to recognise professional women boxers. “Changing the Act will be a move in the right direction. There is a need to change that Act so that it also covers female professional boxers. At a time the Act is silent on professional female boxers, female boxers that include Monalisa Sibanda and Kudakwashe Chivandire have done well in professional circles.  “However, on the amateur side we do not have any problems because our constitution allows us to use International Boxing Association (IBA) rules where we are affiliated. We are governed by the Sports and Recreation (SRC),” said Masiyambumbi. Matabeleland South provincial boxing co-ordinator Maculwamahle Nkomo bemoaned the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act’s failure to provide for participation for all including women and people with disabilities. She said there was a need to include everyone in sport for the benefit of the country as a whole. “It’s a disheartening development. The growth of professional boxing and wrestling into a thriving industry in Zimbabwe can become a reality and as a province we have always believed they can create employment in both disciplines. Our key thrust has been to push for everyone’s inclusion, that is women and those with disabilities. “Everyone should participate in boxing and wrestling as an athlete, official, coach and in any other way. It all calls for total inclusion, it is combat sport no one should be left behind. We are not gifted in the same thing and as a province we are making strides in trying to train deaf people who are interested in boxing,” said Nkomo. – @FungaiMuderere    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/hollick-wins-fbc-zim-open-championship/,Hollick wins FBC Zim Open championship,"Eddie Chikamhi, Harare Bureau GOLFER Michael Hollick kicked off his birthday week in a magical style after he beat a strong field to lift the 2024 FBC Zimbabwe Open Golf championship for the first time at Royal Harare yesterday. Hollick, who turns 37 this Wednesday, needed to summon all his golf prowess to finish with a 20-under-par 268 after an epic final day against South African compatriot Darren Fichardt, who pushed him to the limit with his 18-under-par 270. Zimbabwe’s top professional Scott Vincent was in third place with a respectable 14-under after a feisty last two days on the greens. His brother Kieran Vincent also put up a commendable show, tied for fourth place with Swedish golfer Frederick From. Another Zimbabwean Ben Follett-Smith was sixth on 11-under while highly rated Zimbabwean golf prodigy Matthew Bramford, was the top amateur after finishing on 38th place with a course par score 288. But as has become the norm, it was the South African golfers who dominated the event. Hollick, who won his second Sunshine Tour title with the FBC Zimbabwe Open success, was excited to be on the winning podium, six years after he last participated in the Harare event.  “It’s always amazing to be here. I haven’t been here since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic so coming back was nice and the golf course hasn’t changed in the last five years. It’s always brilliant from the first time I played here in 2011. So I am very pleased,” he said. The 36-year-old had to hold off competition from compatriot Fichardt with six birdies for his final round 66. Hollick had a one-stroke lead going into the final round after he had followed up his first two rounds of 66 and 67 with an impressive 68 in the third round on Saturday, leaving him on 15-under-par. He had a bogey on the 11th hole but the script still went his way yesterday with a crucial birdie in the 17th as Fichardt was dented by two bogeys on the second and 11th holes despite also carding six birdies on the final day.  “It was great,” said Hollick.  “I have been lucky enough to play a lot of tournament golf with Darren over the years and he is one hell of a player. So I knew he wasn’t going to give it to me today and I had to go out and win it. Fortunately, I had the goods and I produced it in the end. “And, the biggest thanks go to the fans here; to the crowd that was out here thank you so much. You really make the most incredible environment for us to play.  “I also want to thank Royal Harare Golf Club for hosting us. The golf course was absolutely amazing and I can’t thank you guys enough.  “I also want to thanks Darren Fichardt, it was a hell of a battle today. We had a good go out there and well-played,” said Hollick.   For the umpteenth time, the Zimbabwe Open Golf title evaded the locals who were left waiting for their breakthrough 24 years since Mark McNulty became the last Zimbabwean to win it in 2000. Scott Vincent reignited Zimbabwe’s hopes for the better part of yesterday but his five-under 67 was not enough to give the top two South Africans a jolt as he settled in third place.  His brother Kieran Vincent had started the day as the best placed Zimbabwean on 11-under par but he failed to continue with the momentum from the previous day. Bogies in the eighth, 10th and 13th holes came at a huge cost for the younger Vincent.  Scott Vincent said the course was tough and will try again next year to challenge for the Zimbabwe Open. “The Sunshine Tour is always strong,” he said.  “They always play really tough and obviously it’s good to have them come here and play and it was fun to play JC Ritchie. He is a fantastic player, he played on the world stage.  “So all in all it’s a strong field and it’s good to be here. I would love to come back and play every year. We have just to see the scheduling and how it all works out,” said Scott Vincent.  Sunshine Tour Tournament Director Gary Todd was thrilled by the successful hosting of the R2,5 million FBC Holdings-sponsored event.  “On behalf of the Sunshine Tour I can’t thank FBC Holdings enough, it was such a fantastic event. It would be rude of me not to mention the Royal Harare Golf Club course staff who have preserved the facility this week in the most outstanding condition.  “To the people of Harare, who have come out and supported us during this magical week, I can’t believe it has gone so quickly and we won’t see you for another year, it’s too long,” said Todd.      "

Goals from Gift Mwinga and Cleopus Dube either half of the break condemned the WiFi boys to their fourth defeat since the start of the campaign. The loss means Telone’s winless streak at home stretches to four matches having last won at home against Manica Diamonds in the second week. WiFi boys coach Tendai Chikuni admitted his side was not good enough. “If you look at it when you play with young guys you have to be at your best, I lost two players. If you look at the backline we lacked cohesion,” he said. “Football is about winning, we are creating and not scoring goals, we will see what happens in the window. Some of the players are not good enough.”  His counterpart Day Gutu was relieved at winning the game after a seemingly difficult period . “It was a sink or survive match for us seeing that we were sitting in a precarious position, so I am relieved that this match has given us the confidence,” Gutu said. Chegutu got the match off to a flying start, taking the lead courtesy of a Mwinga goal after five minutes. The visitors won a free kick on the edge of the box and Mwinga curled the ball in albeit with assistance from TelOne goalkeeper Matripples Muleya who misjudged the flight of the ball. TelOne had the lion’s share of possession but failed to open the Chegutu defence. After a barrage of attacks from the home side, Chegutu doubled their lead with Dube’s glancing header in the 68th minute. The second goal appeared to have given the visitors confidence as they started passing the ball around to frustrate their opponents.   "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/chevrons-save-face/,Chevrons save face,"Brandon Moyo, [email protected]  BRIAN Bennett once again proved why he has been touted as the future of Zimbabwean cricket after a brilliant all round performance which helped the Chevrons secure a consolation eight wickets win in the last T20I against Bangladesh at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh yesterday.  The 20-year-old Bennett took two wickets with the ball (both in the power play) as the Chevrons restricted the Tigers to 157/6 in 20 overs before he went on to score his maiden half-century to help Zimbabwe finish on 158/2 in 18,3 overs.  The Chevrons skipper, Sikandar Raza also came to the party with the bat, scoring an unbeaten half-century in the chase after four low scores.  The youngster was named player of the match.  After salvaging some pride and avoiding a whitewash in yesterday’s encounter, Zimbabwe lost the five-match series 4-1. Speaking after the match, Raza said with the close margin defeats they suffered in the third and fourth games, he felt that the win would finally come and is glad they managed to get it right in the final game and return home with something in the bag.   He added that scoring runs took the monkey off his back.  “It’s nice to go home with a win. Like we said in the last three games we were working our way closer and closer to the victory margin. It’s nice to contribute. In the last presentation I came here and said the only jigsaw puzzle that’s missing is me scoring runs.  “If I can contribute towards the succession of the team it will give me immense pleasure and today is one of those days. It’s always nice to contribute towards the winning of the side. I am very proud of the squad and I’m sure these young guns will take Zimbabwe forward,” said Raza.  Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bowl first.  Bennett and fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani were the most successful Chevrons bowlers, picking two wickets apiece.  Bennett finished with figures of 2/20 while the lanky Muzarabani had figures of 2/22 in their four overs. Bennett had Soumya Sarkar and Towhid Hridoy caught for seven and one run respectively.  Muzarabani had Tanzid Hasan and Mahmudullah caught as well for two and 54 runs respectively. The other two wickets that fell were taken by Zimbabwe’s all time leading wicket taker in T20Is, Luke Jongwe and Wellington Masakadza.  Mahmudullah’s 54 runs came off 44 deliveries and was the Tigers’ top run getter while Jaker Ali finished unbeaten on 24 runs off 11 balls.  In their chase, Zimbabwe’s opener Tadiwanashe Marumani fell early for one run off seven balls before solid partnership between Bennett and Raza took the team across the line.  Bennett would go on to fall for his career high of 70 runs off 49 deliveries while Raza played a crucial captain’s knock of 72 runs not out from 46 balls. Jonathan Campbell remained undefeated on eight runs from nine balls.  The two Chevrons wickets that fell were taken by Shakib Al Hasan and Mohammad Saifuddin. They had figures of 1/9 and 1/55 respectively both in four overs.  It was an encounter that Bennett bossed with both bat and ball while Raza rediscovered his form. – @brandon_malvin     "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/arsenal-beat-utd-to-return-on-top/,Arsenal beat Utd to return on top,"Arsenal returned to the top of the Premier League and ensured the title race will go to the final day with victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. The Gunners delivered an unconvincing display against a severely depleted United side but did enough to secure the win that puts them one point ahead of Manchester City having played a game more. Leandro Trossard struck after 20 minutes when lazy defending from struggling veteran Casemiro played Kai Havertz onside and his cross was turned in by the Belgian at the near post. United showed plenty of endeavour but suffered from a glaring lack of quality and never seriously tested Arsenal keeper David Raya, as their own hopes of European football next season faded further. Arsenal must now hope north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur do them a favour by getting a result at home to Manchester City on Tuesday. The Gunners host Everton in their final game of the season next Sunday, while City are at home to West Ham. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe chose to cast another eye over Erik ten Hag’s struggling side rather than travel to Wembley to watch United win the Women’s FA Cup for the first time. It is hard to work out what Ratcliffe would have learned from watching another home defeat — other than it simply re-affirming the size of the job he has on his hands lifting this fallen football giant. United’s squad, hardly fit for purpose when all players are available, was stripped of key assets such as captain Bruno Fernandes, who watched from the directors’ box with a pained expression.  Ten Hag, his smart suit soaked by a torrential downpour amid a thunderstorm that hit Old Trafford late on, will point to his lack of resources – and rightly so on this occasion. But the fact United were unable to cause Arsenal keeper Raya any serious problems was a sobering lesson in the current state of the Red Devils. Kobbie Mainoo tried to galvanise the hosts’ midfield while Alejandro Garnacho ran tirelessly out wide, but it was a tough afternoon for young striker Rasmus Hojlund, who got very little change out of Arsenal defensive duo William Saliba and Gabriel. United are a club that needs a reboot and re-invigoration and – while this was not the day to make judgements on Ten Hag – it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how the Dutchman can be part of the new era and structure under Ratcliffe. The elation of Arsenal’s fans at this vital win was not dampened by the storm that arrived in Manchester just before the final whistle as skies darkened and lightning flashed around the stadium. Arsenal know Manchester City’s fate still lies in the champions’ own hands and two wins against Spurs and West Ham will take a fourth successive title to Etihad Stadium. Mikel Arteta’s side, however, have done all they can and two hazardous-looking fixtures — away to Spurs in the north London derby and here at United, where they have suffered before — have been safely negotiated. No matter that this was an Arsenal display lacking their usual fluency — at this stage of the season the only currency that counts is wins and the visitors did the job. Once again Trossard made the difference with a trademark swoop at the near post ahead of Casemiro and Aaron Wan-Bissaka for the decisive moment. Arsenal will now hope Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou is as good as his word and they can somehow raise themselves to upset City. The Gunners still have a chance of their first title in 20 years going into the final game of the season – and they would have happily settled for that in August. – BBC Sport   "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/only-two-games-remain-in-liverpools-2023-24-season/,Only two games remain in Liverpool’s 2023/24 season.,"The expectation of many supporters before a ball was kicked was to get back in the Champions League after a year away from Europe’s elite competition, though the dynamic soon shifted after an encouraging first few months for the club. Liverpool quickly became involved in a Premier League title race with Arsenal and Manchester City, claimed the Carabao Cup and had their sights set on a historic quadruple – as was the case two years prior. The Reds’ title bid has since faded and the club are set to end Jurgen Klopp’s farewell season with just the one piece of silverware to their name. Injuries have badly affected Liverpool’s ability to continue fighting on all fronts, having missed key personnel missing for large chunks of the calendar. Those recruited last summer have each adapted reasonably well to their surroundings, though not every individual has been able to remain consistent. Looking back on 2023/24, four Liverpool supporters have shared their views as part of a weekly ECHO fan column while selecting their Player of the Season.Reacting to this damaging defeat, four Reds have shared their views as part of a weekly ECHO fan column. I’ve been incredibly proud of the team and what we’ve achieved during this transitional season. In keeping with the whole Jurgen Klopp era, it’s been an emotional journey with ups and downs – but you can’t say for one moment that it’s been boring. We’re still a team who play with heart and soul, even during the moments when it’s not going our way. With that in mind, my Player of the Season award goes to a man who knows adversity well – and that’s Joe Gomez. He’s stepped up to the plate time and time again when needed and put in some crucial performances across the campaign. I think his strength of character and devotion to the club has been unparalleled on and off the pitch. Ain’t nobody, like Joe Gomez. Andrew Cullen
The team’s performance over the season has ebbed and flowed. Dominik Szoboszlai’s blistering start to the season was followed by an indifferent end to it. Darwin Nunez has looked world class on occasion, but far too often he has lacked composure in front of goal. Luiz Diaz, on the other hand, has continued to shine throughout the season. It’s true that he has been guilty of spurning chances, but he has continued to be influential in games and his sheer tenacity and work ethic is always evident. His performances have been all the more impressive when we recall how much of a turbulent year he has had off the pitch. There were some whispers that the front three would need to be replaced next year, but insofar as those whispers have any substance, it would be a grave mistake to lose the creative Colombian. Although Diaz has taken the crown for my Player of the Season, I should say that Virgil Van Dijk was a close contender. He has been imperious this year. His comments this week about his commitment to the new club project was a real lift, in what has been an underwhelming end to the season. Picking this year’s player of the season isn’t as straightforward as it seems. Seasons are long, but this felt longer than others, and it was hard to pick out a single player who has consistently stood out. Early on it was the Hungarian Dominik Szoboszlai – he couldn’t put a foot wrong. A case can be made for Caoimhin Kelleher, who deputised brilliantly in Alisson’s absence, and Conor Bradley made a superb showing, replacing an injured Trent Alexander-Arnold. But those were temporary. One of the most surprising turns was the performance of the unheralded signing, Wataru Endo. By the time December rolled around, he had become my player of 2023. But I must admit, I made that choice partly because it was a less obvious one. Trent Alexander-Arnold, perhaps? But this season didn’t quite feel like his. Mohamed Salah, of course, should be in the conversation, but do we give it to him by default? Virgil van Dijk stepped up during his first season as captain, but our defensive frailties saw our title challenge curtailed in April. If push comes to shove, I’ll have to go with the Argentine Alexis Mac Allister. His star has consistently shined the brightest for the longest time. He is always there, always putting in a shift and rarely plays abysmal football. It’s pleasingly tough to choose a Liverpool Player of the Season. Good cases can be made for several: Alexis Mac Allister, for instance, has offered consistent composure and class within different midfield roles; Jarell Quansah has taken to senior football with such smoothness and steeliness; while Mohamed Salah has now exceeded 35 goal involvements in each of his seven seasons at the club. I’ve gone for Virgil van Dijk, though. Having been appointed captain within an eventful summer, the Dutchman has risen to the additional responsibility. It’s easy to forget that there were questions aplenty around how the squad would function after last season’s challenges and the departures of former skipper Jordan Henderson and vice-captain James Milner. Van Dijk’s 2023/24 levels have been among the highest of his Liverpool career, which is saying something. In and out of possession, defending high or deep, he’s represented a linchpin in the midst of regular rotation. We’ve also watched him score, of course, including that raucous Carabao Cup final winner – arguably the moment of the season. Getting Jurgen Klopp to lift the trophy with him is a decision that’s aged well. Extending our No.4’s contract beyond 2025 is rightly seen as a priority. – yahoosports Only two games remain in Liverpool’s 2023/24 season.
