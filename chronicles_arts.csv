https://www.chronicle.co.zw/picasso-leon-sizibas-journey-in-portrait-artistry/,Picasso Leon Siziba’s journey in portrait artistry,"Sipepisiwe Moyo, [email protected] Picasso Leon Siziba, a renowned visual artist known for his captivating portraits of South African musicians who visit Bulawayo for shows, has reflected on his artistic odyssey defined by both obstacles and dreams. He started exploring art at the age of nine, inspired by his namesake, Pablo Picasso. “I was named after Pablo Picasso, a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who was recognised as one of the most influential artists in the 20th century. I grew up in a family of artists and started drawing when I was nine years old. “During the Covid-19 lockdown, I started mastering my skills, specifically in portrait art. As I practiced, I got inspired by a South African artist called Young Creator,” he said. As his career progressed, Siziba found success, attracting clients and earning recognition for his work. He has since expanded his artistic horizons by venturing into the realms of Amapiano music and fashion using the medium of portrait art. Picasso Leon with Murumba Pitch Siziba has made a name for himself by sketching Amapiano musicians and presenting these portraits as gifts when they visit Zimbabwe. His work first caught the attention of industry figures like Bassie (Basetsana Kumalo) and Ambitious Entertainment. “The first artist I presented a portrait to was Young Stunna, who really appreciated it. This has motivated me to continue creating and hopefully make a living from my art,” he said. Siziba’s recent works include portraits of Amapiano duo Murumba Pitch and South African hip-hop stars Emtee and Kwesta. “My latest portrait project featured Murumba Pitch alongside South African hip-hop icons Emtee and Kwesta, who performed in Bulawayo on April 27 this year. It took me over two months to complete the portraits. “Among the notable figures I’ve depicted and presented portraits to are Musa Keys, Amaroto, Nkosazana Daughter, the late Costa Titch, Ami Faku, Tyler ICU, Sir Trill, Stokie as well as Zimbabwean artistes like Holyten and DJ Liz. Additionally, I have pending portraits for Cassper Nyovest, Felo le Tee, Mawhoo, DJ Maphorisa, Kabza de Small, Lady Du and many more,” he said. Picasso Leon and Kwesta Despite his success, Siziba faces significant hurdles. “Procuring materials and equipment is tough as they are scarce in our country,” he said. Siziba said some event promoters and organisers either sabotaged him or exploited him. “It’s difficult getting opportunities to showcase my works at events. There’s sabotage by the promoters and organisers leading to me being scammed or used by clients or event organisers. “Also, as fine artists, we’re taken for granted in places like Bulawayo. Art is not seen as something important or valued. I have been struggling to secure an art studio because even venues like the Bulawayo National Art Gallery have been unable to accommodate me,” said Siziba. He however, said his goal this year is to innovate his portrait style aiming to create storytelling portraits featuring prominent figures from around the world. Siziba said he will continue to present his artworks to celebrities as a marketing strategy to enhance his reputation.    "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/a-widows-recipe-for-resilience/,A widow’s recipe for resilience,"Mbulelo Mpofu recently in Ntabazinduna Two years ago, Nomsa Tshuma’s world was irrevocably altered when her husband, Elvis Nyathi, fell victim to a barbaric xenophobic attack in Johannesburg, South Africa. The harrowing incident left her isolated and burdened with the sole responsibility of raising their four young children, as well as an immense emptiness in her heart. On April 6, 2022, in Diepsloot, Johannesburg, Nyathi was subjected to a violent assault by a group of protestors. The mob, driven by accusations against Zimbabwean nationals for local crimes, attacked and set Nyathi ablaze. Following this devastating event, his remains were laid to rest in Bulawayo in a State-assisted funeral. The shocking and untimely demise of Nyathi captured the nation’s attention, prompting widespread calls of support for his bereaved spouse. In those moments, it appeared that all hope was extinguished, as the wheels of justice turned agonising slow. Yet, in an unforeseen turn of events, Tshuma discovered a haven of solace and resilience at ACAJA Chillspot, a lively entertainment venue nestled in the Bhekeni Luthi area of Ntabazinduna. It is here that she has taken on the role of a cook.
During a visit by the Saturday Chronicle’s news team, Tshuma said ACAJA Chillspot has become a rejuvenating oasis in her life.  Her affiliation with the establishment has not only provided her with financial security, but has also imbued her with a renewed sense of purpose and community. “Ever since Abednico Dube (ACAJA Chillspot owner) offered me a job here, it hasn’t been smooth sailing, but a huge load of pressure has been relieved from my shoulders. The warm and supportive environment prevalent here has enabled me to heal and move forward, one delicious meal at a time. I am glad to be part of something special. “I was struggling to make ends meet and provide for my children after my husband’s brutal passing. I miss him, but being here helps me heal and try to forget everything. Since I started working at ACAJA Chillspot, I have been able to give my children a better life. They’re thriving, and that gives me the strength to keep going,” Tshuma said, her voice trembling with emotion. Tshuma’s culinary skills have become a source of solace, allowing her to express her emotions and channel her grief into something positive. The kitchen has become her sanctuary, where she finds peace and comfort in the simple act of cooking. “Cooking is my therapy. When I’m in the kitchen, I forget about my troubles and focus on creating something beautiful and nourishing for others. It’s a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there’s always hope for a brighter tomorrow,” Tshuma explained.  As she expertly prepared a sizzling dish for patrons, her face radiated a sense of pride and accomplishment. Although her husband may be gone, his memory lives on through the love and care she pours into every meal she prepares and the smiles she sees on patrons’ faces. “I am grateful for ACAJA Chillspot and the opportunity to work with such an amazing team which values my presence and contribution. Working closely with our site manager, Langelihle Nyathi, has been great because not only are we colleagues here, we are also close neighbours in the precinct. “ACAJA has given me a second chance at life, and I’m determined to make the most of it,” she said. — @MbuleloMpofu "

Tapiwanashe (32) is the first of two sons. He attended Milton Junior and Milton High School. While not particularly drawn to sports in his school days, Tapiwanashe went on to earn qualifications in accounting and even delved into Sports Science at both Nust and Unisa. Tapiwanashe landed his first accounting job at Edgars where he spent five years. Despite the lucrative nature of accounting, Tapiwanashe found himself increasingly drawn to fitness and began dedicating a significant portion of his free time to working out at the gym. He went on to participate in Mr Novice Zimbabwe in 2018 and gained a commendable runner-up finish. Later that year, he won Mr Africa Zimbabwe and was crowned the prestigious Fitness Icon of the Year in Nigeria. This victory motivated Tapiwanashe to take up the sport seriously, and he started competing in more competitions, winning more titles and enjoying it more. Tapiwanashe Zimhamba He has amassed a significant social media following, exceeding 85 000 fans and landed brand partnerships beyond Zimbabwe and collaborations with Verimark. In recognition of his achievements, Tapiwanashe was voted Zimbabwe’s Social Media Fitness Personality in 2023. “I used to participate in a lot of clubs at school like Debate and Interact, not sporting activities,” he said. “In those five years (at Edgars) I wasn’t satisfied so daily after work I would go hit the gym. Then one day I decided training other people was what I loved. I then started including other people in my training schedule and this kick started my fitness career.” The Mr Novice Zimbabwe competition in 2018 marked the start of Tapiwanashe’s competitive journey. “This competition gave me confidence and I could face my fears so I ended up doing fitness modelling which was a boost to my fitness career and that put me on the map,” he shared.  Tapiwanashe’s success continued in 2018. After winning Mr Africa Zimbabwe, he represented the nation at a competition in Nigeria. He founded Next Level (NXTLVL), a comprehensive fitness brand, which offers a range of sportswear, supplements, personalised nutritional advice and fitness training programmes. “NXTLVL is a sports brand that is going to take over Africa in the next two years. Like Nike and Adidas, it is going to be the biggest fitness sports brand spreading hope and motivation to the hopeless African child. “As NXTLVL, we also do charity work every Saturday at George Silundika and 9th Avenue called ‘Feed for Free Zimbabwe’ where we provide the homeless with a warm plate of food,” he said. His online presence has allowed him to connect with a wide audience and promote his various endeavours. In 2022, he ventured into acting, securing a role as a bodyguard to the character “Mrekza” on the popular South African soap opera, Generations the Legacy. The experience showcased his talents beyond fitness and modelling. Beyond his professional pursuits, Tapiwanashe enjoys cycling as a recreational activity that also maintains his fitness. “Cycling is a fantastic sport and recreational activity that offers numerous benefits, whether you’re a professional cyclist or just enjoying leisurely rides,” he says. He also continues his modelling career with Edgars. Demonstrating his commitment to inspiring others, Tapiwanashe co-hosts a weekly fitness show on Bulawayo’s Skyz Metro radio station alongside Taboka Nleya. Furthermore, his influence extended to being recognised among the top 50 influential Zimbabweans in South Africa.   "

Mothers around the world are celebrated for their tireless love and dedication. But the question remains — what’s the ideal Mother’s Day gift? A generic cake or the now-routine brunch reservation feels impersonal. It’s time to ditch the uninspired routine and truly spoil your mama. The Saturday Chronicle hit the streets of Bulawayo to ask mothers themselves what they crave most this year. Sithokozile Dube from Magwegwe suburb shared a heartfelt sentiment. Her greatest gift would be lasting love from her children, not just on Mother’s Day. It saddens her that some children use this day as a performative display of affection, neglecting their mothers throughout the year. “Once children are able to do that, it’s easy to get the perfect gift for your mother because you will know what it is that she wants and expects. “Most of our children just send us to these expensive lunches that we do not even like because it will be crowded and that’s not a great sight for most of us,” said Dube. Buhle Gumbo stressed the importance of thoughtful gifts. She suggested presents that are both useful and hold sentimental value — things a mother can see and use every day. Here are some ideas to inspire you, even after Mother’s Day has passed: Upgrade your mother’s space Has your mother been eyeing a new appliance or piece of furniture? Surprise her with a delivery. Imagine her delight relaxing on a new sofa or admiring a mounted TV after a long month. Renew and revive Is the kitchen paint peeling? Revamp it overnight for a fresh look! Replace those worn floor tiles she has been complaining about. For bigger dreams, consider building her a new home that’s if you can afford to! Even smaller fixes like repairing a leaky faucet can make a big difference. The gift of family There’s nothing more precious than quality time with loved ones. Plan a gathering where your mother can be surrounded by her children and grandchildren. Embrace the laughter, the playful chaos, and the inevitable (but memorable) family discussions. A taste of adventure Break the cake routine! Does your mum have food she’s always wanted to try? Take her to a new restaurant or introduce her to a unique cuisine. Plan an exciting outing like zip-lining or a boat cruise — create new memories together! Remember, these are just starting points. The most important thing is to make your mother feel truly special and loved, whether it’s through a thoughtful gift, a helping hand around the house, or simply spending quality time together. "

An award-winning author, unconventional entrepreneur and mental health advocate, Siziba shatters the mould of success. Hailing from Bulawayo, her journey is interlaced with resilience, innovation and an unwavering commitment to positive impact. From a young age, she displayed an insatiable curiosity and a fierce drive to excel. “Growing up, I was always a curious child. I played almost every sport in junior school and even joined the birds club, where we learned about various avian species. I vividly remember a moment when, amid a room full of relatives, I confidently declared that I wanted to be a businesswoman when I grow up. The laughter that ensued made me realise that I was different, destined for a path less travelled,” she recounted to Chronicle Showbiz. Her literary foray began as a path to personal healing. Writing became a cathartic release, allowing her to process emotions and find solace. As she shared her work on social media, she discovered a profound resonance with others. This connection propelled her to compile her writings into powerful books that ignite hope and champion mental well-being. Her debut book, “Why I Never Gave Up”, garnered global acclaim, winning the African Author Award in empowerment. It even received a nomination for best self-help book at the prestigious US Author Academy Awards. Princess Nomalanga Siziba Fuelled by her storytelling passion, Princess established “WING UP Publishing,” empowering individuals to share their narratives with authenticity and impact. Guided by the belief that every story holds value, Princess fostered a publishing house attracting clients globally, spanning the UK, Germany, China and South Africa. Remarkably, she achieved this entirely virtually, operating from her mother’s house in Cowdray Park. Beyond literary triumphs, Siziba has made significant strides in the skincare industry. Inspired by her own battles with severe teenage acne, she embarked on a year-long research odyssey to unearth natural solutions. “What most people don’t know is that I was one of those teens who struggled with severe acne. I’d even be teased at school with one student once saying to me, ‘your skin looks like a bar of soap that has been rolling in sand’ in reference to how rough and grainy my skin looked. “My confidence and self-esteem took a knock and I started wearing hats a lot at school to cover the acne. As I matured into adulthood I was still dealing with that acne. I’d go broke just trying to fix my skin as I would go for the most expensive acne treatments thinking it would help me and eventually, I got tired of it all and decided to commit to a year of researching on natural skin solutions. That’s until I stumbled on an article about Zumbani tea,” she said.  Fuelled by a year of research, her unwavering determination crystallised into “Indalo” in 2021. This ground-breaking brand, Zimbabwe’s first 100 percent vegan and organic skincare line, takes pride in Zumbani tea as its unique hero ingredient. Backed by science, Indalo’s products harness the power of Zumbani tea’s rich antioxidants to nurture healthy skin. Siziba’s relentless drive has garnered well-deserved recognition. In 2022, she was crowned one of the top 100 Zim Achievers and Influencers in Matabeleland. The same year, she triumphed at the Zimbabwe Business Youth Expo, earning the prestigious recognition of the United Nations — a testament to her exceptional entrepreneurial spirit. Most recently, she secured the coveted best innovation award under ZimTrade’s Export incubator programme, solidifying her position as a visionary leader in the skincare industry. “Participating in the Zimbabwe Business Youth Expo was a life-changing experience. It opened doors, instilled confidence and helped people trust the Indalo brand even more. The recognition I received has propelled my aspirations and I now firmly believe that Indalo can become a global brand to be reckoned with,” she said. Siziba’s journey as a businesswoman is deeply rooted in her experience with the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE). She credits the programme for equipping her with the essential foundation to thrive. AWE instilled in her the importance of a strong Unique Selling Proposition (USP), allowing her business, Indalo, to stand out from the crowd upon launch. Siziba leverages the power of storytelling in both her business and advocacy efforts. Recognising the impact of emotional connection, she integrates compelling narratives to drive success. Indalo products Her passion extends beyond entrepreneurship. Drawing on her experiences and wisdom, she champions mental well-being and strives to uplift and inspire others. “When others heal, I heal too. My purpose is to serve through my writing and entrepreneurial pursuits, sharing the things that have helped me overcome challenges and motivated me to rise again.” Siziba urged young authors and entrepreneurs to shun procrastination. “Start right where you are. My journey began in Cowdray Park, the least likely place for people to succeed, but I dared to believe that I could be the first of something. Starting is half the battle won. A year from now you’ll be proud that you started,” she said. As an avid reader and YouTube videos enthusiast, Siziba also loves travelling. Unbeknown to a lot of people, Siziba has also tried her hand in music as she once won a singing competition at the late Cont Mhlanga’s Amakhosi Theatre when she was in high school, but due to lack of mentorship, “the passion kind of disappeared”. Looking ahead, Siziba envisions a future filled with innovation and expansion.

To address this gap, last month she started the Girl Get Up Movement, a women’s empowerment programme aimed at young women and teenagers. The initiative provides a space in which women can share strategies and insights to navigate daily difficulties. It has received requests to expand to other cities and Michele hopes to collaborate with other organisations offering psychological, mental and social support to women. Some of the women who attended the girl get up movement   “I remember there was a time when I was in a dark place and I had no one to confide in. It became so bad to an extent that I lost weight and was thinking of taking my own life. When I looked at my own situation, I realised there are so many other young people who are going through the same thing and they have no one to turn to, that’s why I decided to start this movement so that it could be a safe space for such women,” said Michele. The project’s first session focused on learning to manage pain from past experiences, conducted with the help of a therapist.  “Most women are hurting because of past events that is why we decided to start with a letting go session. Because of these past events we are holding on to, our mental health and social lives end up being affected. “During the session, girls wrote down all hurtful things they now want to let go on a glass plate, so they could move on with life. As a sign of breaking from those, we all smashed the plates. The next session is going to be the ‘Sis Are You Ok’ movement. It’s going to be like a follow up to what we did just to talk about how the girls are doing after the letting go session,” she said.  “My greatest drive is to help other women and our hope for the future is inviting organisations which are also into psychological, mental and social support such as Friendship Bench, Zwala and Musasa, who deal with women protection. Some cases that come up in our sessions need strong psychological counselling, support and legal representation. Once we have those partnerships. We can be able to direct those cases to those organisations and work hand-in-hand with them,” said Michele. — @flora_sibanda "

The book is set to be launched tomorrow at Hope City Centre Church in the CBD. The book launch will be hosted by Bryce Andiswa Dube and graced by guest of honour – veteran playwright Raisedon Baya with fellow guest speakers, rapper Meet Luminous and Annie Litso. Entertainment will be provided by Skaiva, Bongy, Mega and Dr MTK. Historically, “Jane the Ghost” is a modern adaptation of a long-standing urban legend from Bulawayo. The myth has been handed down through the ages, captivating each generation with its eerie tale.  According to stories, Jane was believed to be a ghost who assumed the guise of a prostitute during the late 1980s and early 1990s. She became infamous for her deceitful tactics, luring unsuspecting men into her web of deception characterised by her uncanny ability to vanish without a trace at Pelandaba Cemetery, leaving her bewildered victims behind.

Bolamba Performing Arts will perform the Setape dance, while Blanket Mine Chiwoda brings the Chihoda Yao dance to the stage. Also competing are How Mine, dancing the Beni Arinoti and How Mine Gure, which will showcase the Zambia gure dance. The Isitshikitsha dance will be performed by the Sekusile group and the Bira dance will be presented by the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service Beitbridge camp. William Ndinde, the NACZ acting communications and marketing manager, expressed excitement about the preparations. “Everything is in place for us to host one of the first provincial finals in Matabeleland South province, coinciding with Mashonaland East. We expect another year of fun and pomp through dance.” —@mthabisi_mthire "
https://www.chronicle.co.zw/the-soulful-journey-of-nkayis-bongani-mpofu-and-his-witnesses-of-christ-ensemble/,The soulful journey of Nkayi’s Bongani Mpofu and his Witnesses of Christ ensemble,"Sipepisiwe Moyo ,[email protected] Bongani Mpofu, the founder of the contemporary gospel group “Witnesses of Christ,” has seamlessly integrated his deep passion for music with his community involvement. Born into a musical family in Nkayi, Mpofu began showcasing his vocal talents in grade 4, performing at his local SDA church and school. At 14, Mpofu joined the Gonye AY choir as a tenor. He recalls, “I remember dreaming about singing new songs on stage. I didn’t take it seriously at the time because I was young.” Despite his early visions, establishing his first group in 2005 proved challenging due to his father’s disapproval of church-related activities. The group eventually disbanded, but this setback didn’t deter him.  In 2009, he formed “Witnesses of Christ” with all members originating from Nkayi. Although most belonged to the Followers of Christ Church, the group also included members from other denominations such as AFM and UCCSA. Financial struggles were a constant hurdle, especially since Mpofu was unemployed at the time. He recounted, “I was already composing my own contemporary songs. We participated in competitions in Nkayi and our church, and we were a winning group.” In 2011, the group’s breakthrough came when they travelled to Bulawayo to record a six-track album with Video Visions studios. Unfortunately, due to a lack of systematic planning, the album did not achieve the expected success, leading Mpofu to re-record it in 2012.  Their 2013 attempt to release a 10-track album was thwarted by unresolved debts with the late producer, Joe Maseko, and the album was never collected. Driven by his faith and dedication to the gospel, Mpofu continues to pursue his music career against all odds.
“I sing gospel because I live the gospel; it’s my life. I am a servant of God, called to this path, and I must follow what I feel inside,” he expressed passionately. His multifaceted career also spans roles as a registry clerk and a pastor, showcasing his diverse skill set. Looking to the future, Mpofu is excited about his latest project, a 2024 gospel album titled “I Bow Before You” featuring six Ndebele tracks and two in English. He remains committed to uncovering and nurturing hidden talents in Nkayi and the broader Matabeleland region, not only in music but also in poetry and visual arts. “There is hidden talent in Nkayi which I wish to bring to light. If you can dream it, you can achieve it. Let’s stand up, campaign, and showcase our talent. The light has already been put on and it’s growing; together, we can make it,” he concluded, filled with optimism. Ends// "
