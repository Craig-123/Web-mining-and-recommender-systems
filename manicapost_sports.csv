The victory, the Gem Boys’ sixth on the bounce, saw them keeping another clean sheet to propel coach Jairos Tapera’s charges to the summit of the log standings with 22 points from 11 games. They now enjoy a one-point lead over former champions FC Platinum who defeated dislodged early pacesetters Highlanders 2-0 at Babourfields. Not only did Manica Diamonds collect the three points at stake, but also grabbed the bragging rights of a contest many may view as a derby since both teams are using Sakubva Stadium as their home ground. For red-hot Tapera, this was the fifth consecutive time he has found the back of nets as his team stays on the hunt for title glory. On current form, the Gem Boys have turned around their fortunes after enduring a sluggish start to the season; thanks to their sparkling form.   "

Senior Reporter THE better team of the day is highly likely to get both the three points at stake as well as the support from the terraces when Manica Diamonds host Bikita Minerals at Sakubva Stadium in a Castle Lager Premiership encounter set for Sunday. Both Manica Diamonds and Bikita Minerals use Sakubva Stadium as their home ground, and so far they have all enjoyed the backing of the hard to please Mutare football fans. With Manica Diamonds now on second position on the Castle Lager Premiership table following their sudden resurgence which has seen the Mutare diamond miners going for six consecutive matches collecting maximum points, Sunday’s league encounter presents yet another stern test of character for coach, Jairos Tapera and his men. On the other hand, Bikita Minerals have been enjoying considerable support of local fans each time they are at Sakubva Stadium due to their exciting passing game, a known trademark style of play for teams coached by veteran gaffer, Saul Chaminuka. Thus, Tapera, reckons the challenge posed by the lithium miners in their fine run. “We respect Bikita Minerals as they have been posting very good results. Remember, we are sharing the same stadium as our home ground, and the same supporters making it an interesting derby. “We are preparing well for this encounter. We will play with a positive mind. We have been doing well of late, and we would like to continue with that fine run,” said Tapera. The former Young Warriors gaffer attributes his club’s fine run to the hard work and commitment that all members of his team have invested in the project. “We attribute our fine run to hard work being put by the players. The level of commitment is just impressive. I believe this also has more to do with team work by both players and technical team,” said Tapera.    Bikita Minerals Saul Chaminuka He said they are not reading too much into their current position on the table, and are only concerned with collecting maximum points with each passing match. “We are not looking at the position we are at the log. It is still very early. We are just working hard to maintain the form and try and win as many matches as possible,” said Tapera. His opposite number, Chaminuka understands the enormity of the task ahead of him and his club. Chaminuka said: “This is the game of the year for both teams as either side knows how important winning this game is. “We are sister clubs fighting for bragging rights, and the good thing is that we are all home this week. The team that settles first and handles the fire thrown at it well will win. “Mutare fans are in for a treat this weekend. I promise them fireworks during Sunday’s match at Sakubva Stadium. Sakubva will be the best place to be after church.” Chaminuka hinted that he is staying put at Bikita Minerals after several clubs expressed the desire to lure him. “I am at Bikita and this Sunday, I want our fans to concentrate on pushing our boys so that we come out of this one with maximum points. We want to amass as many points as we can so that we end this first round with points that will see us instead of being threatened with relegation, we will be fighting for a top six finish. “I believe that achievement will be like winning a title in our debut season. My message is, let us see what we started through together. Our God whose name is Jehovah will lead the way as always,” said Chaminuka.   "

Senior Reporter   A TOTAL of 99 participants from different parts of the country converged at Sakubva Primary in Mutare recently for the highly rated International Athletics Referees’ Course Level One, a crucial stage in the globally acceptable Technical Education and Certification Officiating Systems (TOECS). The 99 were drawn from Manicaland (64), Masvingo (14), Midlands (three), Mashonaland West (three), Mashonaland Central (eight), Matabeleland South (one) and Mashonaland East (six). The course was organised by Mutare Athletics Board in conjunction with the Manicaland Athletics Board. Participants in the course went through lessons in entries in competitions at international standards, attire, officials’ categories, running events, field events (jumping and throwing events), race walking, combined events (heptathlon, octathlon, and decathlon), indoor athletics and anti-doping. International instructor, Irene Chineka, one of the only three instructors in Zimbabwe, was the chief facilitator during the well-attended course. Chineka said: “This is the third course of its nature that we are having this year around the country, and we are happy with the response we are getting from our targeted participants. It really shows that we have come of age in athletics as we now understand the importance of technical expertise in managing our competitions. “It is important to note that this course is crucial in enhancing the professional approach to athletics competition management, and it is recognised globally. These participants can officiate anywhere under the sun with this qualification. Therefore, we congratulate them for the sacrifice they have made to be here, and hopefully, they will play an important role in nurturing our budding athletes.” Mutare Athletics Board chairperson, Godfrey Ndinangepi, who was also the assistant facilitator during the recent course at Sakubva Primary School, said: “As Mutare Athletics Board, one of the seven boards we have here in Manicaland under Manicaland Athletics Board, we are excited to have managed to host this event successfully. We strongly believe we have played a huge role in capacitating our athletics officials, and this should culminate into more professional handling of our competitions.”   "

Sports Correspondent CRICKETERS and sports personalities have been urged to take a firm stance against performance-enhancing drugs and abuse of other drugs and substances as they can have detrimental effects for both the individual athlete and the integrity of the sport. Addressing young cricketers and sportsmen at Mutare Sports Club last Saturday, Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Misheck Mugadza said a nation with drugged people cannot develop. The event was hosted by the Premier Cricket Academy and was held under the theme: “Batting Away Substance Abuse”. “We must take a stand and actively work towards creating a society that is free from the clutches of substance abuse. Only a healthy society can stand resolute to develop its country. Just as you use your skills and determination to bat away every ball that comes your way, we must collectively work to bat away the lure of drugs and substance abuse from our communities. “As cricketers, you have a unique platform to inspire and educate the masses. Your dedication, teamwork and perseverance on the sports field are qualities that many look up to and aspire to emulate. It is, therefore, crucial that you recognise the influence you have, and use it to advocate for a drug-free society. The use of drugs in sport and in the society, not only affects the individual, but also has a profound impact on families, communities, and the nation at large. “More importantly, let us band together, like a strong cricket team, to bat away substance abuse. Let us educate, support and empower our communities to make informed decisions and reject the allure of drugs. Together, we can be champions, not only in cricket, but also in the fight against drug abuse,” said Mugadza. He added that drug and substance abuse also has health implications. “For example, anabolic steroid abuse result in cardiovascular problems, hormonal imbalances and increased aggression. Stimulant abuse can cause heart problems, anxiety and addiction. Additionally, the use of blood doping techniques can lead to blood clotting, stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Our dear cricketers, use your influence to spread awareness, support anti-drug initiatives, and be vocal advocates for a drug free lifestyle. Your actions, both on and off the field can inspire positive and change the world,” he said. Manicaland cricket administrator, Terry Nyakurimwa said: “The use of drugs and substance abuse by youths is now a major concern. We urge kids to come and play cricket and shun all social ills.”   "

Senior Reporter   THE 2024 edition of the rebranded Mwana Rugby Festival has come and gone, but the boost in talent development at national scale will remain its greatest legacy, while participants from Manicaland Province are still counting the sporting as well as social gains of having been part of the 120 schools that took part in the competition. Mavhudzi High, one of the three schools from Manicaland that participated in the competition held in Harare last week, played three matches like the rest of the teams that participated. Of those three matches, Mavhudzi played against Dzivarasekwa, Tichakunda and Pathway Group of Schools. They won the first match, drew the second and lost the last one. Mavhudzi High School coach, Takudzwa Mudzuka, said: “It was a learning curve for the team as a whole, and hopefully we will have three wins during the next edition of the tournament. We played very well during our first two matches, but injuries saw us having five key players being retired to the bench during the last match. “Everyone played well, but our captain, Ashley Tsar Chimbandidza and Blessing Boika Murangwana were instrumental in rallying the team.” Marist Nyanga and Mutare Boys’ High School were the other two schools that participated. Mwana Group proprietor, Kuda Mutenda said: “Some of the success areas include the fact that rugby was played at all levels, by 120 teams (8am to 5pm, over seven days). This is the only rugby tournament which attracts a number of schools as they don’t have leagues during the year. “Long term infrastructural improvements and developments to the host school were also witnessed. More than 250 people were trained in five different courses (Level One Coaching, Level One Referees, Level One Medics, Sports Science and Sports Administration) free of charge to the participants. “People who normally do not watch rugby were given a chance to watch and enjoy rugby. In short, we gave hope to the country. ?50 talented and promising (boys and girls) athletes were selected for specialised further development to fully realise their potential over the next 12 months, with a regional tour to Zambia in 2024 in the pipeline. “It is also worth noting that this competition defied social barriers, as all social classes were represented and enhanced participation of women and the girl child, both on and off the pitch. “Lastly, but equally important is the fact that we aggressively campaigned against drug abuse through the whole festival, with over 1 000 learners going through counselling sessions from qualified doctors and counsellors from Drug Free Zim,” said Mutenda. Manicaland Rugby Board chairperson, Mos Kapumha, said: “We would like to appreciate the school heads who made it possible for their schools to be part of this national festival, the biggest and longest running in Zimbabwe – The Mwana Festival. “The players, both boys and girls, were given good quality opponents and exposed to the country’s finest rugby playing schools. The coaches’ tactics and credentials were put to test. “A big thank you to the organiser, Kuda Mutenda and his Mwana Festival committee for embarking on this journey and giving our learners a platform and opportunity to express their talents, skills and humility on such a grand stage. “We have 10 rugby referring officials who were part of these games. They were giving their services and also horning their skills. One of them was Eve Chisingarambwi, a new certified Rugby Africa match commissioner. It was a first for Manicaland. The Mwana Festival Super Week also came with a training and education programme which saw three Manicaland participants, two ladies and one male getting certified across different strands accredited by World Rugby.”   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/i-feel-so-sorry-for-him-no-kane-no-gain-for-bayern/,"‘I feel so sorry for him’ – No Kane, no gain for Bayern","The ManicaPost   WHEN Harry Kane was on the pitch, Bayern Munich were heading to the Champions League final.   When he wasn’t there, they weren’t — and aren’t. Thomas Tuchel substituted Kane in the 85th minute against Real Madrid.   At that point, Bayern were protecting a one-goal lead and were going to Wembley with the England captain having led their charge. So while there are other factors in play — notably Manuel Neuer’s error as he spilled the ball to allow Joselu his first of a dramatic late double, plus Madrid’s innate ability to win big European games even when hope seems lost — the substitution has been pinpointed as the turning point. It also encapsulates what the 2023-24 season has been for Bayern — a campaign where they have looked lost when without Kane. And now, Kane ends his debut campaign at Bayern with nothing. “He has done his job. He has scored the goals,” Champions League winner Rio Ferdinand told TNT Sports. “They brought him to continue winning trophies and I feel the others have let him down more than anything. I think he will have a heavy heart tonight.” While Bayern were after the seventh European Cup in their history, Kane was looking for the first major trophy of an otherwise stellar career. Certainly, this season could not have been better from an individual perspective for Kane, scoring 44 goals in all competitions — his best ever scoring season. Yet while Kane has shone, this flawed Bayern side have fallen short and will end the season without a major trophy for the first time since 2011-12. “I feel so sorry for Kane. What a superstar he has been and he doesn’t have an opportunity [in a Champions League final],” former Bayern midfielder Owen Hargreaves told TNT Sport. “Poor guy. He has been amazing this season and that just didn’t go to plan in the last 10 minutes.” In that 2011-12 campaign when Bayern finished empty-handed, Kane was finishing a season on loan from Tottenham to Millwall, where he scored seven goals in 22 League One games and was still a year away from his Premier League debut. This season, he has almost singlehandedly tried to drag Bayern to glory. Bayern’s second highest scorer, Jamal Musiala – also subbed off in Madrid – has just 12 goals in all competitions. However, hampered by poor performances and bad decisions around him, Kane has come up just short. Bayern lost their 11-year grip on the Bundesliga title to Bayer Leverkusen, were knocked out of the German Cup by third-tier Saarbrucken and now they will be stunned having seemed set for an all-German final in the Champions League. After a quiet opening quarter of the match at the Santiago Bernabeu, Kane sprung to life with a snap volley from the D in the 28th minute which Andriy Lunin had to go full stretch down to his left to save. But Bayern around him were again off the pace, with a passive showing that saw Madrid dominate. Only a series of fine saves from Neuer kept the tie level, until Kane made his most telling intervention. Alphonso Davies’ strike with his supposed weaker right foot to put Bayern ahead on the night caught the eye, but it was Kane who made the play by dropping deep, then spraying an idea pass out to the left for the Canadian full-back to take on, cut inside and fire home. Kane’s value to Bayern stretches way beyond goals.   He even led the complaints to the referee when Nacho shoved Joshua Kimmich in the face before Madrid appeared to have equalised, prior to the goal being ruled out by VAR. But then came the turning point, as with five minutes remaining Tuchel replaced Kane with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as part of a series of changes to try and see out the match. “That will be viewed as the moment Tuchel lost this for Bayern,” German football expert Archie Rhind-Tutt told BBC Radio 5 Live. “You could see it in his facial expression after the second Madrid goal went in – he looked shaken. He usually has a very good poker face, Tuchel. That for me was a guy who knew it had all gone wrong.” Tuchel, due to depart at the end of the season, defended his call, saying Kane was in no state to continue. “He couldn’t keep going. He played with back pain and he couldn’t keep going, his back froze up,” Tuchel said. Shortly before Kane came off, Choupo-Moting’s fellow former Stoke City player Joselu was thrown on by Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti — and he snatched the striking glory. As the Real players streaked on to the pitch to celebrate Joselu’s winner, Kane was left in the away team dugout to wonder what might have been. – BBCsport.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/maradonas-stolen-golden-ball-to-be-auctioned-off/,Maradona’s ‘stolen’ Golden Ball to be auctioned off,"The ManicaPost   DIEGO Maradona’s “stolen” Golden Ball trophy, awarded for being named the best player at the 1986 World Cup, has been found and will be auctioned off in France on 6 June. The Aguttes auction house announced on Tuesday that the item had resurfaced and they expect it to be sold for “millions”. Maradona, who died in 2020, won the award after leading Argentina to World Cup victory in Mexico. “There are a lot of stories and legends, like it was stolen by the mafia to make gold,” the Aguttes auction house sport expert Francois Thierry told BBC Sport.   “We did all the necessary checks and called the police about it. “We have had the ball for about one year. We did a lot of research about it since there are a lot of details in terms of manufacturer comments until we could say it was a good one.” The Golden Ball was bought by the anonymous seller in 2016 at an auction in France. However, he was unaware what item he had purchased. “He bought it with many other things, at the beginning he did not know it was something important,” Thierry added. “In the case he bought there were a lot of trophies. He then searched on the internet and found it could be the Golden Ball. “He tried to call Maradona and Fifa, but had no luck.” The 1986 World Cup arguably is best remembered for Maradona’s two goals against England in the quarter-finals. Maradona outjumped England keeper Peter Shilton to punch his first goal into the net with a raised fist, which was later described by the Argentine as being scored by the “Hand of God”. His second was voted as the “Goal of the Century” in a Fifa poll, Maradona dribbling from his own half past five English players to score. Both the jersey he wore that day, along with the ball from the match, have previously been sold at auction for millions. “The trophy symbolises the pinnacle of his career and he is the player of the century,” Thierry said. “We can see there were some results from before when his jersey against England in 1986 being sold for I think £9m and the ball of the game went for £2m, so we expect millions.” — Online.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/i-dont-trust-anyone-how-trolling-hurt-kipchoge/,‘I don’t trust anyone’: How trolling hurt Kipchoge,"The ManicaPost   TWO-TIME Olympic champion Eliud Kipchoge says he feared for the lives of his family during a campaign of online abuse that wrongly linked him to the death of fellow Kenyan marathon runner Kelvin Kiptum. Kiptum, the world record holder who looked set to challenge Kipchoge’s dominance over 26.2 miles, died aged 24 in a car crash in February. Some social media users began to speculate that Kipchoge was part of a conspiracy to kill Kiptum, who had lowered the world best to two hours, 35 seconds last October in Chicago. “I was shocked that people [on] social media platforms are saying ‘Eliud is involved in the death of this boy’,” the 39-year-old told BBC Sport Africa. “That was my worst news ever in my life. “I received a lot of bad things; that they will burn the (training) camp, they will burn my investments in town, they will burn my house, they will burn my family. “It did not happen but that is how the world is.” Kipchoge’s initial reaction when he saw the abuse and false rumours was to check whether his family were safe. “I don’t have power to go to police and tell them my life is in danger. So my concern was actually to tell my family to be extra conscious and cautious,” he said. “I started to call a lot of people. “I got really scared of my children going to school and coming back. “Sometimes they bike around, but we had to stop them because you never know what will happen. We started to drop them [off] and pick them [up] in the evening. “My girl was in boarding school – that was positive that she had no access as far as social media is concerned – but it’s tough for my boys to hear ‘Your dad has killed somebody’.” Kipchoge was overtaken by emotion during a candid interview at his home in Eldoret when discussing the impact the campaign of abuse had on his mother. “My worst moment was (when) I tried to call my mum,” he said. “She told me ‘Just take care’ and ‘A lot has been going on’. “Where I come from is a really local area. And with the age of my mum, I really realised that social media can go everywhere. “But she gave me courage. It was really a tough month.” However, Kipchoge, who became just the third person to win successive Olympic marathons when he defended his title in Tokyo in 2021, decided not to take precautions over his own safety. “I saw no meaning to change training venues because my life is open,” he explained. “Our sport is not training in the gym, it is going outside to run. I walk in the streets freely.”
Kipchoge claims he “lost about 90 percent” of his friends amid the wrongful link to Kiptum’s accident and online abuse. “It was really painful for me to learn even from my own people, my training mates, those who I have contact with, and the bad words are coming from them,” he added. “I was really down to see that.” Kipchoge’s team decided to take the distance runner off social media in the wake of the abuse, but he said he never considered deleting his accounts. “If I delete my accounts then it shows that there is something I am hiding,” he said. “I will keep my accounts. I did not do anything.” However, he believes the social media abuse affected his performance in competition. Kipchoge came 10th in the Tokyo Marathon on 3 March, his lowest finish since his debut in 2013, crossing the line over two and a half minutes behind the winner Benson Kipruto. “When I was in Tokyo I had three days which I did not sleep,” he revealed. “It was my worst ever position.” Despite that setback he was named in Kenya’s marathon team for the Paris 2024 Olympics last Wednesday, and is now focused on creating more history at the Games as he aims to win a third successive gold medal. “It’s about getting up and going straight again, to your goal,” added Kipchoge, who in 2019 became the first person to run a marathon in under two hours, albeit in controlled conditions in Vienna. “I want to go into history books, to be the first human being to win back-to-back-to-back.”
Having been on the receiving end of intimidation and threats, Kipchoge believes social media companies are “not doing much” to clamp down on abuse on their platforms. “These faceless people are posting bad things and are really dangerous,” he said. “If you report some accounts then it takes time for them to delete those accounts. “They should act fast, get the facts, delete accounts. People [should] know that if you say something which is not good then your account will be deleted.” However, Kipchoge has welcomed an announcement from the International Olympic Committee that it plans to “respond proactively and at scale” to safeguard athletes from online abuse during Paris 2024. The IOC intends to use artificial intelligence, external to help identify abusive posts and report them to social media companies. “I think it’s actually the right direction,” he said. “They are now stamping their authority and their function as an organisation handling the athletes to safeguard them from abuse.” But, for Kipchoge, it is already too late to avoid the emotional scarring he has suffered.
“I learned that friendship cannot be forever,” he said. “I think it’s unfortunate that it happened when I’m celebrating over 20 years in sport. “What happened has [made] me not trust anybody. Even my own shadow, I will not trust.” — BBCsport.   "

Senior Reporter THERE is something crazy about the game of football — perhaps that is where its beauty lies! The first four rounds of the 2024 Castle Lager Premiership matches saw Manica Diamonds lying in the relegation zone on the log table — having conceded seven goals in four matches. In fact, after Match Day Three, Manica Diamonds anchored the log table. Amid speculation over his job, their coach, Jairos Tapera, even admitted that failing to get a win in the opening four matches of the season was worrisome. At that point, Tapera felt that the team’s defence was their weakest link. “As the head coach, I am very worried about the way we have been conceding, especially in our first two games, but we have been working very hard on that area (defence) and what we now need is to improve on our confidence,” he said then. Fast forward to five weekends, Manica Diamonds eased into the second position on the log table after an impressive five matches unbeaten run. And last Sunday, second half super substitute, Michael Tapera blasted a hard and low shot off a rebound after a corner kick to give Manica Diamonds their first triumph over FC Platinum since joining the Premiership, and also their fifth victory on the bounce. Against all odds, the club has been winning home and away, much to the amusement of Tapera. “We always attribute everything to God who has blessed us as a team to work and understand each other. These boys are all my sons. We have a father and son relationship, and always reflect on previous games and try to find information on our next opponents so that we can work on ways to overcome them. “We are a team full of ambitions, we really want to win something as a team,” said Tapera.    Manica Diamonds goalkeeper, Godfrey Chitsumba has also performed well between the sticks He believes the change of fortunes has been a direct result of shear hard work by all members of the team. “Every member of our team is putting a very strong performance. Yes, we can mention a few, but that will not take away what every player has put in, even those not selected on a particular day still work hard at training,” he said. The former Young Warriors gaffer admitted that winger, Michael Tapera was in a terrific form. Apart from sharing the same surname and team, the two namesakes are not biologically related. Apart from speedy winger, Tapera, who is nicknamed Chimudhudhudhu, goalkeeper, Godfrey Chitsumba has also been a vital cog in their transformation. Interestingly, it is the same defence that a few weeks ago has been leaking goals like a sieve, which has transformed into the solid bedrock of Tapera’s success story. “Yes, Michael Tapera has done very well for us with three goals in five matches. We also have Farai Banda who has two goals in as many matches. “We have our defence which has done very well with only a goal conceded in the last five matches. We also have our goalkeeper who has garnered four clean sheets in five matches,” he said. Manica Diamonds will face ZPC Kariba in their next assignment, and Tapera fully understands the threat posed by Kauya Kuturuturu. “It is very difficult to maintain form. We are going to ZPC Kariba, and this is even a more difficult assignment, considering that they have been performing very well in their recent matches. They have been posting impressive results at home and away. “We respect them a lot, but we are preparing and taking that match like any other important away game. We are going there to compete and give it all our best to get a positive result,” said Tapera.   "

Senior Reporter CASTLE Lager Premiership debutants, Bikita Minerals are holding on to him, GreenFuel and Hwange want him, while TelOne has placed a counter offer on the table to lure him. His name is Saul Chaminuka. After parting ways with head coach, Rodwell Dhlakama, the Chisumbanje-based Green Fuel-based outfit, whose turnover of coaches is fast becoming worrisome even to its sympathizers, is now chasing the signature of Saul Chaminuka. GreenFuel chairman, Fred Moyo confirmed their undying love for the experienced gaffer. “Yes, we are keen to have Saul Chaminuka on board. We are engaging him and our negotiations are at an advanced stage. We have every hope that he will settle for GreenFuel. Anytime from now we could be announcing his arrival at GreenFuel,” said Moyo. On the competition that his club is facing in signing Chaminuka, the GreenFuel boss said: “That is the nature of the game. Saul Chaminuka is a good coach, no doubt about that. Therefore, it is not surprising that many clubs are after him. However, I hope we will be able to meet and exceed his expectations.” The former now defunct Eastern Lions coach, Chaminuka is highly rated in domestic top-flight league as a shrewd tactician who can achieve results even with an average side. To lend credence to Chaminuka’s capabilities, Bikita Minerals did not have meaningful pre-season preparations as they were locked in some boardroom Premiership promotion issue that involved Tenax FC, but the team is competing favourably, playing an entertaining brand of football. This also explains Bikita Minerals’ reluctance to release the experienced gaffer. However, information gleaned by this newspaper indicate that Bikita Minerals are not adequately remunerating their players and coaches with unconfirmed reports that they are owed about four months’ salaries. This leaves the gaffer thinking twice should a striking offer be tabled.   "

Senior Reporter IT’S two steps forward and one step backwards for the development of rugby in Manicaland after the once enterprising rural-based Sahumani Secondary School girls team failed to make the trip to Harare for this year’s inaugural Mwana Rugby Festival due to lack of resources. The festival was previously known as Dairibord Rugby Festival, which is arguably the country’s biggest annual rugby competition. The festival was previously bankrolled by milk and milk products producer, Dairibord, before takeover this year by Mwana Group, which manufactures vehicles accessories and doubles as a trucks and buses dealer. But it is this year’s absence of Sahumani Secondary School girls team — hailing from the undulating terrain and deep thickets of Honde Valley — that easily captures the attention of those who have been following their Cinderella story in the game of rugby. When the girls at Sahumani Secondary School started playing rugby back in 2017, they had to make do with the soccer pitch and the oversized football shirts used by the boys. Five years down the line, several of the girls ere representing the country in the sport, while girl rights activists credited the project for saving them from becoming child brides. Manicaland Rugby Board chairperson, Mos Kapumha admitted that the absence of Sahumani is testimony of lack of grassroots sport support in rural areas. “Our plea is for corporates, local businesspeople and politicians to help support the development of sport. This helps to bridge the gap between societies, be it either in sport or academics and at tertiary or school level. This lack of support also stifles the growth of the game in marginalised areas and demoralises the players and coaches who would have worked hard and sacrificed their time and effort, only to be let down on the 11th hour by lack of resources. “So there is need for collective support from parents, school administrators, community leaders and the business community to make sure that these players’ dreams are nurtured and actualised,” he said. However, Manicaland is not without its representatives at this year’s edition of the competition after Mavhudzi High boys and girls, Mutare Boys’ High and Marist Brothers Under-16 as well as senior teams are in attendance. “As Manicaland, we are pleased with Mavhudzi High, Marist Brothers and Mutare Boys’ High School’s participation at the inaugural Mwana Rugby Festival. “These teams were drawn from three districts out of seven. Sahumani failed to travel at the 11th hour from Mutasa North in Honde Valley due to lack of funds. “The participation of the three schools is good and shows that rugby is alive and thriving in schools in the province. It shows a great deal of commitment even from the school administrators towards sport and providing equal opportunities for their learners and a balanced curriculum. This also helps to prepare these schools for the upcoming national and provincial schools rugby league. Manicaland will have a schools’ rugby league starting in May when schools open. “Mutare Boys’ High and Hillcrest will be taking part in the CBZ national schools league. Manicaland schools will be busy this second term playing in structured rugby leagues provincially and nationally in line with the National Development Strategy (NDS1),” he said.   In the ongoing Mwana Rugby Festival which ends on Sunday, Mavhudzi was its Under-20 boys edging Dzivarasekwa 12-7 on Monday.   "

The bout is being promoted by BoxAfrica Limited, an entity duly registered with Zimbabwe National Boxing and Wrestling Control Board, with jewellery firm, Betterbrands having expressed a keen interest to come on board as a principal sponsor. Betterbrands director and Mabvuku-Tafara Member of Parliament, Scott Sakupwanya is not new to boxing after sponsoring celebrated boxer, Floyd Mayweather’s visit to Zimbabwe in 2023. The visit was dubbed: “The Homeland Tour”. Themed: “The Grand Finale – KnockOut Drug Abuse Now,” the contest is being earmarked for this winter, with Sakubva Stadium being the preferred venue, albeit pending availability. Information at hand indicates that the promoter intends to include four boxers from Malawi on the rich fight card so as to give an international flair to the tournament. Manyuchi (34) who is arguably the most decorated boxer in the country, has since indicated that he is on the verge of spiking his gloves after an eventful professional career that earned him a total 13 international titles. These include the African Boxing Union welterweight belt, World Boxing Council international and silver, World Boxing Federation world, Global Boxing Union, Universal Boxing Union, World Professional Boxing Federation and the World Alliance Boxing Association supreme titles. In a journey that spans two decades, the sports ambassador boasts of 29 victories, 18 of them knockouts; four loses and a single draw in the professional ranks. It is this feat that earned him the Annual National Sports Awards’ Sportsman and Sportsperson of the Year gongs in two consecutive years – 2015 and 2016. He has also been twice hosted by the country’s two Presidents, and handed tokens of appreciation for having hoisted the Zimbabwe’s flag high. Promoter, Gilbert Munetsi, who is also Manyuchi’s publicist, advisor and biographer confirmed that plans are at an advanced stage to have Manyuchi fight before his fans in Mutare. “I can confirm that we have covered some ground in arranging this milestone event, and it is our fervent hope that Mutare folks will be treated to the best a promoter can offer in terms of a boxing bill. “I can confirm that we have now been given the greenlight by the boxing sanctioning board to have the tournament after meeting the initial requirements expected of us. “While we have had a positive discussion with Betterbrands, it is our hope that the business community in Mutare will also seize the opportunity and join hands with us. They will reap benefits from associating with the brand Charles Manyuchi. “It is an event that happens once in a lifetime, and the most beneficiaries in this arrangement remain the corporate sector and residents of Mutare in general,” he said.
Manyuchi, who was last in Mutare as a guest of Government when the province hosted the Zimbabwe National Youth Games some years back, said he is thrilled to take his act to Manicaland. “I love Mutare particularly for its hospitable people and the tourist attractions. But for me it is always business first. That “The Guy” has challenged me is testimony to his bravery. “I have followed his boxing journey and have to admit that he has what it takes to get to the top. I am in camp preparing for the Mutare tour of duty and I promise the fans the best of ‘The Busy Bee’,” he said. The developments come at a time when Motsi is on cloud nine after scoping a silver medal at the Mandela Cup competitions which took place in Durban, South Africa, recently.   "

In front of a passionate home crowd hoping to see the five-time champion conjure a fairy-tale run deep into the second week in what is expected to be his last appearance at the event, 30th seed Lehecka spoiled the party with a 7-5 6-4 victory in just over two hours. Immediately after the match Nadal said farewell to fans in an on-court interview as the tournament unfurled five banners marking each of his five victories in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2017. “This is one of those days that when it arrives, it’s very tough, but life and my body have been sending me signals for a long time,” he said. “The dream was to finish here on court. I have been fortunate in my life to turn my passion into my job, I am privileged.” The 22-time Grand Slam champion arrived in Madrid saying he wasn’t fully fit and was worried about his condition, but in the end was celebrating having won three consecutive matches without showing significant physical limitations. Nadal had only one break opportunity against the big-serving Lehecka who has now won all of his three matches in straight sets. “It’s amazing to share a court with such a legendary player. It’s a dream come true; I always wished for this to happen,” Lehecka said. “I’m very grateful to achieve such a big moment and all the best to Rafa. It’s kind of bittersweet to have such a nice win in front of all these people who were cheering for him. The energy was amazing.” Alcaraz battles past dogged Struff Carlos Alcaraz was pushed to the limit, but found the answers when needed to overcome a gutsy Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-4) in a repeat of last year’s final. The 20-year-old is aiming to become the first player in history to win three straight titles at the ATP Masters 1000 event. “Honestly this match reminds me of last year’s match,” Alcaraz said. “It was pretty difficult from the first point until the last one. It was a great fight and it was difficult. It was difficult for me to deal with my emotions, to handle certain moments, difficult moments in the match. “Serving for the match, it was really difficult for me after that 40-0 up, but really happy that at the end it didn’t affect me with my game, with my mentality. I kept fighting. That’s all that matters and I’m really happy to get the win at the end.” “What a great battle,” Andy Murray’s former coach Miles Maclagan said on Sky Sports Tennis. “The style of game they play and the contest – nothing but respect for Jan-Lennard Struff. “For all that effort there’s no reward in the end but perhaps he’ll take a lot of heart in the way he’s played, the way he’s pushed Alcaraz, the way he’s continued to show resilience and character when I’m sure most would have been writing Alcaraz’s name into the next round. “He kept coming and kept coming and never got down on himself. That is one of his big attributes. This guy’s bag of tricks is a large one. “The power he brings, the athleticism, the punch as well.”— Supersport.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/how-much-is-manchester-uniteds-squad-worth/,How much is Manchester United’s squad worth?,"The ManicaPost   MANCHESTER United have put almost all of their squad up for sale as they look to refresh the team and generate funds under new co-owner Ineos.   United have spent about £1bn assembling their current squad over the past few years, but have endured a disappointing season under Erik ten Hag. Given they will miss out on Champions League football next year they will need to maximise player sales in order to spend – something BBC Sport’s chief football news writer Simon Stone says they have been “poor at in the past”. United’s most recent accounts show a total wage bill of £331m and an average weekly wage for players of £154,000 – both the fourth-highest totals behind Man City, Chelsea and Liverpool. So what is the value of their squad?   As ever with football transfers, it depends on who crunches the numbers. BBC Sport worked with two respected football data and research providers CIES Football Observatory, external and Transfermarkt, external to calculate the approximate market value of United’s players.   In comparison, Transfermarkt’s ‘market valuation’ is much more modest, and their UK content lead Stefan Bienkowski says it considers factors such as form, age, contract status and its own members’ evaluations. Transfermarkt says three of the top five biggest downgrades in market value, external in the Premier League this season are United’s Antony, Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount.
Here are their valuations: Marcus Rashford (26) “After reaching a career high of £73m in December 2021, Marcus Rashford’s market value has been steadily decreasing since then. It did jump back up to £68m around March of last year, but poor performances have seen his market value drop to where it now stands at £51m.” Antony (24)   “With a market value of £30m prior to his 95m euros (£81.3m) move to Man Utd, our data suggests Man Utd significantly overpaid for the Brazilian winger.   We did adjust the player’s market value to £64m following the move, but his consistently poor performances have seen it tumble back down even lower to £24m.” Jadon Sancho (24)   “Sancho was once one of the most valuable players in the world, when he had a market value of £112m in 2020.   But following his move to Man Utd, his market value has dropped from £77m to £21m following a lack of game time or good performances.   A return to form for Dortmund may interest some potential bidders and his market value will likely rise before the end of the season.” Bruno Fernandes (29)

“The Portuguese midfielder remains one of Man Utd’s few consistent stars, which is why he is currently their most valuable player at £60m.   But with his 30th birthday coming later in the year and his attacking stats slowing down compared to his first few years at Old Trafford, Fernandes’ market value has begun to creep downwards from a high of £77m.   It seems extremely unlikely any club would be willing to pay more than £60m this summer, should the midfielder demand a move from Old Trafford.” Andre Onana (28)

“Signed for 55m euros (£47.5m at the time), Onana had a difficult start to life at Man Utd. Although £34m may seem quite low for a goalkeeper, Onana is the second most valuable shot-stopper in the world.   No club has spent more than 50m euros (£43m) on a keeper since 2018.” Harry Maguire (31)

“Following his record £80m move from Leicester City, Maguire had a career-high Transfermarkt market value of £60m. But over the course of the past five years he has struggled for consistency and has perhaps been the most glaring example of Man Utd overpaying for players.   Aged 31 and with his contract expiring at the end of next season, a market value of £17m for the England centre-half seems fitting.” Scott McTominay (27) “The Scotland international has been a useful player in Erik ten Hag’s team and has seen his market value rise from £27m this season.   Man Utd have never sold a central midfielder for more than about £30m and it seems unlikely McTominay will push that figure much higher.” Diogo Dalot (25) “Signed for £19m, Dalot has seen his market value steadily rise to £30m since he joined the club back in 2018.   This makes him Transfermarkt’s eighth-most valuable player at Old Trafford and our eighth-most valuable right-back in the world.” — BBCsports.   "

Senior Reporter   THE ZIFA Eastern Region Division One Soccer League never ceases to amaze!   GrayHam FC – the club that was at the centre of the ZIFA Eastern Region Division One Soccer League’s Bikita Minerals and Tenax Premiership promotion boardroom drama – has been ‘relegated’ after only three matches in the 2024 season of the second tier league.   According to a communique from the football regional administration body, dated May 2, 2024, and signed by administrator, Fungai Munyoro-Chingaira, GrayHam were relegated for failing to pay in time fines emanating from the Premiership promotion case.   Interestingly, the letter notes that the Eastern Region Division One is currently in the spotlight for not following the rules and regulations.   “Take note of our professional interest herein. We, hereby, advise that you have been relegated from Eastern Region Soccer League with immediate effect as a result of failure to comply with the ruling of the Disciplinary Committee of March 18, 2024.   “Eastern Region is currently in the spotlight for not following the rules and regulations (sic) ref the landmark ruling at the beginning of the season 2024. As a result, Eastern Region has no choice but to follow recommendations from the Disciplinary Committee’s ruling.   “You have been given enough time to make good your fines (sic) but that time has lapsed twice before even a cent was paid. Eastern Region has been asked to observe the rules and regulations and recommendations from the Disciplinary Committee as there are (sic),” reads the ERSL statement.   When contacted for comment, GrayHam FC owner, Gray Hama said: “I am sponsoring football and someone is defeating the cause. That is all I can say.”   Although the use of the word ‘relegated’ is not appropriate, it can easily be construed as expulsion of the club from the league for failing to pay a stipulated fine after a hearing.   This publication understands that after the decisions of the Eastern Region Soccer League self-appointed kangaroo court that set and fined GrayHam FC US$2 500 were reversed by the ZIFA Normalisation Committee, a Disciplinary Committee that subsequently presided over the same matter then imposed a US$4 500 fine on GrayHam FC.   GrayHam FC appealed against the outcome, but the club found no respite after ZIFA requested for US$5 000 appeal fee, which the club failed to raise and were told that their appeal period had lapsed.   Thereafter, the ZIFA Eastern Region Soccer League started giving notices of demanding the US$4 500 payment from the club.   GrayHam FC wrote to the Eastern Region Soccer League asking for a payment plan, which was denied.   Nonetheless, the expulsion of the Ruwa-based GrayHam FC, two days before the regional football body’s Annual General Meeting, smacks of victimisation of a perceived maverick competitor.   The outspoken Hama has made clear his intentions to contest for the Eastern Region Soccer League leadership position.   "
