# Newspaper Text Mining and Recommendation Platform

Developed an end-to-end NLP and web mining solution to extract, classify, and recommend news content from multiple online sources, simulating conversational information extraction and enhancement for digital platforms. Leveraging a Python-based spider, I automatically collected articles from four major newspapers, categorizing stories into Business, Politics, Arts/Culture/Celebrities, and Sports. The system converts raw articles into structured CSV datasets for scalable analysis.

Applied clustering algorithms to uncover latent topic groups and organize news, mirroring approaches used in conversational intent classification and text mining for chatbot platforms. Designed and deployed a web-based application that allows users to explore clustered article groups and access related story URLs, supporting interactive information retrieval and multi-source experience excellence.

Tools & Techniques: Python, web scraping, NLP, unsupervised learning (clustering), data engineering (CSV pipelines), web platform developmen
