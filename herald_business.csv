Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Deputy Minister, Mr David Mnangagwa, told Parliament last week that Government was working closely with the private sector to facilitate small transactions, allowing citizens to access foreign currency legally and conveniently. This follows the suspension of more than 4 000 EcoCash agents in 2020 on allegations of participating in the then rampant trend of charging excessive premiums for customers intending to cash in their mobile money. He announced the change in policy in the Senate last week while responding to Senators’ queries on measures taken by the Government to address illegal foreign currency trading. “We are working on a solution as Government, coupled with the private sector, to allow for small transactions, that is the general populace to be able to get the small amounts, $20 or $50, through negotiations with our mobile network operators to be able to access the bureaux de change that are on their EcoCash or Netcash platforms. “This means if you have an Econet line and if you register for EcoCash, you can convert from ZiG to US dollars, or from US dollars to ZiG at the official exchange rate. That is the first part to allow interchangeability without having to go to the streets,” the Deputy Minister said. This move is expected to promote financial inclusion, reduce reliance on the black market for the small transactions and increase the use of electronic ZiG. The plan, the Deputy Minister said, also involved reactivating EcoCash agents across the country, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that everyone had access to legal foreign currency. “The second part is, we are still in discussion. Right now, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is talking to the mobile network operators, mentioning Econet in particular because they were suspended in 2020 after some issues that now have been ironed   out. “We would want to have agents reactivated so that the most remote areas, our constituents, the citizenry can access both US dollars and ZiG from their wallets. “Econet went a step further last week and zero-rated the charges for sending money from parts of the diaspora to Zimbabwe. This was a show of good faith and support for Government during this El Nino period as well as to show the commitment in bolstering our efforts in supporting and defending.” "

This forecast reflects improvements in the services and trade sectors. However, the IMF noted that the growth outlook remains challenging for Africa’s most populous nation and leading oil producer. In March, food price inflation reached 40 percent, prompting concerns about food security. According to the IMF mission chief for Nigeria, Axel Schimmelpfenning “If Nigeria grows at 3,3 percent that is just above the population dynamics, which is a big challenge.” The Fund projected that fuel subsidies could be up to 3 percent of GDP this year due to the disparity between pump prices and their dollar cost, according to Schimmelpfennig.  He further stated that officials are dedicated to gradually phasing out these subsidies within the next one or two years. “The reforms are focused on how to raise that growth so that Nigerians can see real impacts on their living standards,” Schimmelpfenning said. “We think a lot has happened. We also have to recognise that the problems built up over many years were quite severe. We can’t expect that everything is going to be resolved overnight,” he added. Global rating agencies have upgraded Nigeria’s economic outlook as a result of reform efforts. Fitch, the latest agency to do so, has revised Nigeria’s outlook from stable to positive. Schimmelpfenning noted that scaling up a cash transfer program and increasing government revenues to enhance service provision to citizens are key priorities In terms of monetary policy, the IMF commended the recent interest rate hikes by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to address rising inflation, calling for a data-driven approach for further rate adjustments.– Business Insider Africa

This week, Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), a provider of services for global investors, hinted at ending its adverse view on local equities following the much-improved access to foreign currency allowing offshore investors to invest and repatriate capital. “Starting from the May 2024 index review, MSCI will no longer apply the special treatment for the MSCI Kenya indexes announced on August 8, 2022. Based on the feedback from market participants, liquidity in Kenyan foreign exchange markets and the ability of foreign investors to repatriate capital from the Kenyan equity market has improved,” the MSCI said on Tuesday. The New York-headquartered firm is the proprietor of the MSCI Kenya index measuring the performance of the large and mid-cap segments of the Kenya market in US dollar terms and has three constituents, namely Safaricom, Equity Group and East African Breweries Plc (EABL). In August 2022, MSCI paused the review of the local index, highlighting market accessibility regarding hard currency availability. Other markets that were handed similar cautions were Nigeria and Sri Lanka. MSCI has also ended its forex concerns in Egypt. According to analysts, the end of the special treatment is set to provide tailwinds for foreign investor participation, particularly those investing in Kenya using information from the index. “The review is positive for Kenyan equities and it might help raise the participation of foreign investors. Likely, we will see more foreign inflows, especially for investors who are not too keen to invest in individual stocks but would rather view the market from an index perspective,” noted Wesley Manambo, a research analyst at Standard Investment Bank. – The East African

https://www.herald.co.zw/bad-weather-war-strain-the-worlds-wheat-supply/,"Bad weather, war strain the world’s wheat supply","Bad weather and war are threatening to keep the world’s wheat supplies under strain and reviving the specter of rising food costs. From soggy fields in western Europe to parched soil in Australia and the war in Ukraine holding back supplies, farmers face setbacks.  That means global stockpiles will remain the smallest in almost a decade, according to analysts surveyed ahead of the US government’s first forecast for next season. Bumper Black Sea harvests have long kept a lid on prices and wheat is trading at half its record set in 2022, but supply concerns are mounting again. Futures have rebounded to hit the highest since August and funds are trimming bearish bets that they’ve held for almost two years. That’s a worrying sign for consumers who’ve finally found relief from rising food prices. Any prolonged rally could increase costs for bread and pasta and rekindle inflationary pressure on central banks — with other major crops like cocoa and coffee also climbing this year. “Demand has increased, stocks remain tight globally and new crop issues are escalating,” said James Bolesworth, managing director at CRM AgriCommodities. With Northern Hemisphere harvests approaching, the next few weeks remain critical for crop development, so there’s still time for things to improve — or worsen. Here’s a roundup of conditions in major growers: Top exporter, Russia risks missing out on crucial moisture, with weeks of heat and not enough rain in the country’s south prompting analysts to cut harvest estimates. Half Russia’s winter wheat will remain too dry over the next two weeks, Commodity Weather Group said Wednesday. Russia should still reap a big crop, but its dominance means that any jolts to local prices feed through to other markets — and the country’s wheat has been getting more expensive lately. -Bloomberg

https://www.herald.co.zw/zimre-strategy-still-anchored-on-creating-strong-cash-wallet/,‘Zimre strategy still anchored on creating strong cash wallet’,"Nelson Gahadza Senior Business Reporter Zimre Holdings (ZHL) says its strategy remains anchored on delivering a strong cash wallet by driving a cost-effective insurance float and increasing the contribution from regional investments. ZHL is a diversified investment holding company with core competencies in insurance and property. The company has investments in Zimbabwe and the Southern African region. Mr Stanley Kudenga, ZHL group chief executive officer, told analysts last week that the group would increase the contribution from its regional investments by upscaling their balance sheets and effective deployment of competitive capital across all strategic business units. He said the group would also tilt its property portfolio towards high yielding commercial and retail sectors through near liquid investment structures. “We had an independent actuarial assessment of the depth of the markets that we operate in and the level of competitive capital that would be required and they came up with a figure of US$12 million. “Out of that US$12 million, we have already internally deployed about US$7 million and the remaining US$5 million will need to go into Malawi and Zambia,” he said. In Zambia, Mr Kudenga said there was now a requirement for foreign companies to have local participation at the shareholding level of least 25 percent. As a result, Mr Kudenga said ZHL was looking at doing some kind of a rights issue where it would then cede its rights to selected investors in the local market, which means that there was capital in the local market. “Malawi is almost the same thing but by and large we are also looking at complementing it from capital from the local market,” he said. Mr Kudenga said the group’s cash generated from operations for the year to December 31, 2023 increased to US$13,67 million from US$8,9 million in 2022 in line with the group’s cash wallet model. During the period under review, 84 percent of the group’s revenue was US dollar revenue and all business units generated positive cash flows. ZHL chief finance officer Mr Zvenyika Zvenyika said insurance contract revenue increased by 7 percent to US$62,68 million in 2023 compared to US$58,58 million in 2022. He said the strong top line growth was underpinned by local reinsurance and pensions business operations. The local reinsurance cash contribution was US$1,796 million, Life and pensions US$4,943 million, reinsurance foreign US$3,542 million and property US$2,203 million. “Healthy total income surge was driven by expansion into new markets, introduction of innovative product offerings, new business acquisitions, increased business support, and positive investment income returns,” said Mr Zvenyika. He noted that total expenses were kept under check following the strategic underwriting decision to reduce participation in loss making portfolios and a decline in climate change induced cyclone related claims. Mr Chakanyuka Nziradzemhuka, the chief operating officer said the group completed the balance sheet reorganization of Emeritus International Re in Botswana which serves as the backbone of ZHL’s Great Africa Trek. He said the group was exploring new opportunities in Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda. “The group successfully enhanced the Emeritus Re Mozambique balance sheet with a US$2 million capital raise that increased underwriting capacity,” said Mr Nziradzemhuka. As the group’s property portfolio tilted towards high yielding commercial and retail sectors through near liquid investment structures, its Eagle Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) attained Prescribed Asset Status from the Insurance and Pensions Commission of Zimbabwe (IPEC) post the reporting period. Mr Nziradzemhuka said it is anticipated that the Eagle REIT will bring much needed liquidity to the real estate market especially for Zimbabwe’s pensions community. “The Eagle REIT project has been ably supported with one project already underway in Mazowe which is at 13 percent completion. “In Victoria Falls we successfully acquired land and title and the group further extended commitment to the town by securing a refuse truck propelling high standards,” he said. He added that the group will continue to consolidate on its experience and dynamism to enhance market share acquisition through innovations and new tools that embrace customer centric ecosystems which will create new value and change for its stakeholders. During the year under review, the group’s profit increased by 321 percent from $72,4 billion to $304,9 billion in inflation adjusted terms and a 767 percent growth under historical cost terms, soaring to $528,1 billion. The group’s total assets uplifted by 81 percent to $1,180,2 billion from $650,5 billion in inflation adjusted terms and in historical cost total assets grew by 769 percent to $1,151,6 billion from $132,5 billion buoyed by growth in investment properties and equity investments which constituted 70 percent of total assets.

https://www.herald.co.zw/govt-targets-350-000ha-under-irrigation-by-2025/,Govt targets 350 000ha under irrigation by 2025,"Business Reporter THE Government is targeting to increase irrigable land from 217 000 hectares to 350 000 ha by 2025 to accelerate its climate-proof agriculture programmes. In the latest Second Round of Crops, Livestock and Fisheries Assessment report released by the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, last week the Southern African indicated it was underutilising its dams and irrigable land. “With over 10 600 dams capable of irrigating 2 million hectares, and with only just 217 000 hectares functional irrigation in 2024, Zimbabwe has under-invested in this vital enabler and has suffered the consequences through threats to food security,” the report reads. According to the ministry, the targeted 350 000 ha under irrigation by 2025 cannot be achieved with a business-as-usual approach amid calls for radical innovative financing mechanisms, given most of the proportion of the irrigation development has been funded by the Government. This comes after the Government achieved 846 hectares of additional irrigation while the private sector and individuals put a combined 3 325 ha under irrigation. Development partners chipped in with 1 255 ha, bringing the cumulative additional land under irrigation for the 2023/24 season to 5 426ha. This shows that the Irrigation Development Alliance, a Government-initiated, private-sector-led collaboration for exploitation of innovating financing arrangements to unlock resources to develop 120 000ha irrigation facilities in the next two years has begun to bear fruit. According to the ministry, farmers need a reprieve on utility rates and tariffs as an incentive for investing in such critical infrastructure. “Once available, irrigation must be complemented by affordable water charges. Government is gazetting the 31 percent tariff reduction, and streamlining both the ZINWA (Zimbabwe National Water Authority) and Water Acts to reduce bureaucratic sloth, and entrench efficiency,” the report said. Agriculture analyst Mr Vimbai Magura believes lower rates will free funds for farmers to invest in their operations. “Incentives for irrigation-based agriculture are crucial for sustainable farming practices. Lower rates and tariffs provide much-needed relief for farmers investing in irrigation infrastructure. It not only encourages adoption but also fosters long-term viability in agriculture,” he said. Another analyst Ms Sheila Anderson said the planned move was commendable but there would be need for farmers to save water for longer use. “As an agriculture analyst, I emphasise the importance of affordable water charges to support irrigation ventures. The government’s planned move to reduce tariffs by 31 percent is commendable and aligns with the goal of streamlining bureaucratic processes.  Efficient water management is fundamental for boosting agricultural productivity and ensuring food security,” she added. Such initiatives become critical as Zimbabwe is predicted to become drier in the decades ahead, with increased frequency to extreme weather events, so climate-proofing agriculture through accelerated irrigation development must be pursued with the energy and urgency that it deserves.

https://www.herald.co.zw/how-business-has-helped-pull-sa-back-from-the-brink/,How business has helped pull SA back from the brink,"South Africa has gone 43 days without load shedding and Transnet’s rail and port performance is on the mend. All going well, load shedding may be history by the end of 2025. That’s largely the result of the collaboration between business and government, known as the Joint Steering Oversight Committee (JSOC), which was launched 11 months ago to pull SA back from the brink of economic implosion. It was launched under the president’s office at a time when load shedding was a daily occurrence and Transnet’s rail performance had regressed to post-World War 2 levels. A JSOC update last week put some flesh on the skeleton of an initiative that many at the time dismissed as another forum for talk and not much else. More than 150 CEOs from the private sector have signed up for the initiative, which is focused around three key areas deemed most urgent: energy, transport and logistics, and crime and corruption. Some 350 specialists have been deployed to power stations, Transnet and various crime initiatives, racking up close to 7 000 hours of contribution. Here are some of the milestones: Energy Load shedding is down 61 percent for the period December 2023 to February 2024 compared to the same period the prior year; Stage 4 load shedding is down 80 percent; Six gigawatts (GW) of new generation capacity has been added to the grid; The investment pipeline for new power generation has doubled; Requests for proposals (RFPs) have been issued for 7.6GW of renewable energy, gas-to-power and battery storage; New CEO for Eskom appointed (Dan Marokane); The National Transmission Company of South Africa (NTCSA) has been established, and a board put in place to unbundle and separately manage Eskom’s transmission grid; and Eskom’s energy available factor has improved above 55 percent. Transport and logistics New CEOs appointed at Transnet (Michelle Phillips) and Transnet Freight Rail (Russell Baatjies); 36 percent less waiting time to anchor vessels (as at March 2024); 45 percent fewer vessels anchored outside Durban; National Treasury agreed to a R47 billion guarantee for Transnet, subject to conditions; R700 million investment in key rail corridors, much of it for security (with the private sector providing drones and other security support to combat cable and equipment theft); Transnet’s draft ‘Network Statement’ has been published as the first step to attracting private investment and readying the rail provider for competition before the end of 2024; and The decline in freight volumes was arrested in 2024 and volumes for the 2024/5 year are targeted for 193 million tonnes , just short of the 200-220 million tonnes needed to support economic recovery.  – Moneyweb Crime and corruption Twenty high priority and complex cases identified for prosecution with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) as part of a strategy to remove SA from the Financial Action Task Force grey list; Crime call centre modernised; NPA Amendment Bill tabled to establish the Investigating Directorate against Corruption and provide for the appointment of anti-corruption investigators; Exodus of skills from the NPA has been arrested and it is being re-staffed; Plans in place to leverage R56 million investment by the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric) and Banking Association of SA (Basa) for the creation of a forensic analysis centre and training for complex cases; and -A key target is the reduction of infrastructure crime at Eskom and Transnet, and there is evidence that this is happening. ‘Quick results’ Speaking at a PSG investor conference on Thursday, Transnet chair Andile Sangqu said the willingness of business to assist in turning around performance at the ports and rail operator has delivered some quick results. One of these was the supply of drones and 24-hour security on key corridors to combat cable theft, which has been crippling operations. Another was the loan of seven cranes by international shipping companies, which were delivered and deployed to Cape Town to ease port congestion around the festive season. Earlier in the day, Rudi Dicks, head of project management in the Office of The Presidency, pointed to some encouraging investments in the renewable energy space, with a decline in unplanned outages, aided by 4 000MW of new power coming on stream in 2024 and an expected 7 000MW in 2025. James MacKay, CEO of the Energy Council of SA, said ending load shedding is the first target in a much larger campaign towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a tough target that is likely to be missed. This is the same target being pursued by the UK, which has a 15-year head start on SA. The proliferation of rooftop solar systems is an important part of easing the energy crisis, and now the focus is on large corporate buyers and developers building wind and solar systems at utility-level scale. The business partnership with the government has had a significant impact on addressing the energy crisis by building strong governance structures and good working relations through the National Energy A total of R1,5 trillion is needed over 10 years to sustain the energy transition, equivalent to R1,5 billion a year. That requires unbundling Eskom, and setting up a new company to manage power transmission. “We need to get our focus out of energy scarcity and load shedding [and on] to the bigger picture,” said MacKay. Jannie Durand, CEO of Remgro and head of the Joint Initiative to Fight Crime and Corruption (JICC), said crime reduces GDP by an estimated 5%, with knock-on impacts on tax collection and the cash economy. “People must believe in the rule of law. That creates confidence for long term investment,” said Durand. He added that the purpose of the initiative is to create jobs and revive the economy. JSOC is vital to making SA attractive for investment and creating jobs. “If we can get regulatory structure in place, and we minimise [the] trust deficit, there are huge opportunities [in SA]. Look at how many installers have found employment in solar.” Moneyweb "
https://www.herald.co.zw/trading-in-bindura-shares-halted-on-vfex/,Trading in Bindura shares halted on VFEX,"Enacy Mapakame TRADING in the shares of nickel producer, Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC) has been halted on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) after its major asset, Trojan Mine, was placed under reconstruction. This also comes as the resources group has been facing operational challenges amid subdued global nickel prices, which have dropped about 25 percent year on year. Although the reconstruction order was issued against Trojan Mine alone, which is the country’s primary nickel producer, this would have an impact on the entire group, resulting in its suspension, which is the first suspension at the US dollar-denominated exchange. “The Victoria Falls Stock Exchange Limited (VFEX) hereby notifies the investing public of the voluntary suspension from trading in shares of Bindura Nickel Corporation Limited (BNC or the Company) with effect from 06 May 2024 following the placement of its major operating subsidiary, Trojan Nickel Mine Limited, under a Reconstruction Order in terms of the Reconstruction of State-Indebted Insolvent Companies Act (Cap 24:27) (Reconstruction Act),” said head of VFEX markets Mr Robert Mubaiwa in a notice to stakeholders. According to the VFEX, the suspension is for the duration of the administration period, which was announced last week in the Government Gazette. “The Reconstruction Act has among other provisions, the following clause: “6 (d) every disposition of the property, including rights of action, of the company and every transfer of shares or alteration in the status of its members, made after the commencement of the reconstruction, shall, unless the administrator otherwise orders, be void” Although the Reconstruction Order was issued against Trojan Nickel Mine Limited, BNC as the holding company is equally affected with the order pursuant to Section 4 (3) (a) of the Reconstruction Act. “As a result, the administrator has applied for the voluntary suspension in trading of BNC shares on the VFEX,” explained Mr Mubaiwa. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe (SecZim) approved the suspension of the resources group which migrated from the primary bourse Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) in 2021. Earlier, the group cautioned that ongoing low nickel prices, high input costs—particularly electrical expenses—substantial mining depth, and low resource grade persist in negatively impacting its operations. The group highlighted that despite the completion of the Sub-Vertical Rock (SVR) Project, which caused a temporary shutdown of BNC’s Trojan Nickel Mine (TNM) from September 22, 2023, the company continues to encounter various challenges that are expected to cause delays in the resumption of mining activities at Trojan. In a trading update for the nine months to December 31, 2023, the resources group reported tonnes of ore mined at 177 179, decreased by 37 percent in comparison to 281 560 tonnes achieved for the same period last year. In line with the decrease in the tonnes of ore mined, the tonnes of ore milled at 163 674, decreased by 42 percent from 281 135 tonnes recorded in a similar period last year.  Nickel in concentrates produced, at 1 314 tonnes, was 40 percent lower than the 2 192 tonnes recorded for the same period last year due to lower milled tonnage and grade of mined ore.

https://www.herald.co.zw/african-sun-recovers-betters-pre-covid-era/,"African Sun recovers, betters pre-Covid era","Enacy Mapakame Listed hospitality group, African Sun Limited is progressing well in its recovery journey with the group surpassing pre-Covid 19 occupancy levels across its operations during the year to December 31, 2023. According to the group, hotel occupancies increased to 52 percent, which was 6 percentage points above 2022. The improved occupancy paid dividends during the year under review, with the group recording a revenue growth of 30 percent to US$54,73 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The improved performance was driven by firmer Average Daily Rates (ADR), which closed the year at US$110, representing an increase of 39 percent against US$79 achieved during the comparable period as a result of changes in customer mix. Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) increased by 58 percent to US$57, up from US$36 in the comparative period. However, further growth was counterbalanced by an increase in operating expenses stemming from exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures, tempering the overall financial performance. African Sun’s operating expenses, excluding depreciation, increased by 43 percent to US$27,63 million compared to US$19,29 million in 2022 driven largely by exchange rate volatility, inflationary pressures, and the crystallisation of expenses in US dollar as the economy continued to dollarise at a rapid pace. Management at the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) listed firm indicated that the troup will continue to monitor costs and implement various cost-saving initiatives. During the year under review, the group posted an operating profit of US$3,74 million.African Sun, however, recorded a marginal profit after tax from continuing operations of US$0,52 million, largely as a result of the harsh macroeconomic operating environment, characterised by costs escalating at a higher rate than revenues, compounded by material exchange rate losses triggered by the above mentioned rebasing of the group’s functional currency, as highlighted below. The group had a high effective tax rate for the year under review, worsened by declining values of capital allowances due to inflation. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) was US$9,45 million, a decrease from US$17,86 million in 2022, and the loss for the period was US$0,36 million. Two of the group’s hotels under external leases had their base rentals changed from local currency to US dollar, and this had the downstream effect of significantly increasing the lease liability interest and right-of-use assets depreciation compared to 2022. The discontinued operations loss of US$0,89 million largely comprises property and equipment impairments post the closure of The Kingdom at Victoria Falls Hotel and the Makasa Sun Casino. This follows the mutual termination of the lease at The Kingdom at Victoria Falls Hotel, due to an untenable lease tenure. The group will continue looking for suitable expansion opportunities in appropriate locations and with the right timing and funding structures. While the business environment may remain uncertain due to the adverse impacts of the El Nino induced drought on agriculture, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) projections of improved arrivals are encouraging for the hospitality group and the tourism industry in general. The UNWTO projects international tourist arrivals to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, with initial estimates pointing to a 2 percent growth above the 2019 levels, underpinned by increased air connectivity, and continued recovery of Asian markets and destinations. On the domestic front, African Sun anticipates yield on the growing demand for Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing, and Events (MICE) business as well as benefits from several high-profile events, including the just ended Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) and the Victoria Falls Carnival, an event  they are hosting at Elephant Hills Resort and Conference Centre, among others.

https://www.herald.co.zw/fbc-re-bounces-back-to-profitability/,FBC Re bounces back to profitability,"Enacy Mapakame FBC Reinsurance (FBC Re) bounced back to profitability in the year to December 31, 2023, from a $2,6 billion loss recorded during the prior year comparative period. According to the financial services group, the unit achieved a profit before tax of $7,3 billion, supported mainly by investment income. To enhance its product portfolio and consolidate its market share, FBC Reinsurance is developing new products focusing on agriculture, health, and funeral business. “The introduction of these new product segments is aimed at increasing the company’s underwriting capacity and improving the quality of earnings,” said FBC Holdings Group chief executive officer Mr Trynos Kufazvinei in a performance update for the period under review. Additionally, FBC Reinsurance is a signatory to the Nairobi Declaration on Sustainable Insurance, which is supported by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). The declaration encourages insurance practitioners in Africa to collaborate in the implementation of sustainable insurance solutions. Leveraging its geographical footprint in Botswana, FBC Reinsurance aims to explore opportunities to collaborate in the deployment of sustainable insurance risk solutions. Meanwhile, the reinsurance business’ sister company, FBC Insurance reported a $3,8 billion profit before tax jumped 65 percent to $3,79 billion from last year’s $2,3 billion. Mr Kufazvinei highlighted that the gap between the premiums collected and claims paid has been widening due to the foreign exchange rate differentials in the economy.  During the period under review, the economy faced a myriad of challenges. Zimbabwe has faced increased global turmoil over the years, notwithstanding an expansionary monetary policy that has added initial pressure on inflation and the exchange rate.  During the past financial year, the economy battled limited foreign currency availability, inflation weighing on disposable incomes, exchange rate volatility and the wide disparity between official and parallel market rates. “This has made it difficult for industry players to meet the expectations of both policyholders and fund members. As a result, FBC Insurance is focusing on increasing the underwriting of foreign currency-denominated businesses to preserve value,” said Mr Kufazvinei. During the review period, Statutory Instrument 81 of 2023, also known as “no insurance premium, no cover,” was introduced to protect the insurance industry from dishonest creditors. The regulation aims to enhance the industry’s liquidity and claims settlement capacity. As a result, Mr Kufazvinei revealed that FBC Insurance would continue to evaluate the company’s asset and liability management strategies to align revenues with the risk-based capital requirements. Overall, the country anticipates broader financial market regulations, as both monetary and fiscal authorities strive to address market liquidity, price and exchange rate disparities, as well as public debt arrears to support economic growth and job creation. “In this environment, the group is well-prepared to leverage market opportunities and sustain shareholder value. It is critical to maintain an efficient and cost-effective business, coupled with the agility to move and take advantage of opportunities,” he said. "

Total foreign debt climbed to US$168 billion from US$164,5 billion at the end of September and US$162,9 billion at the end of December 2022. Egypt has quadrupled its external debt since 2015, using it to finance various initiatives such as constructing new capital, developing infrastructure, procuring weaponry, and sustaining an overvalued currency, Reuters reported. The central bank reported that the foreign debt, of which 82,5 percent was long-term, amounted to 43 percent of the gross domestic product. Following the Ukraine crisis, which resulted in a chronic shortage of foreign currency and prompted an exodus of foreign investors, the government of Egypt sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The country deliberately allowed its currency to weaken by over 35 percent in a much-anticipated devaluation, potentially opening the door for additional loans from the IMF. In March, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a US$5 billion augmentation to its loan program for Egypt. The approval increased the Extended Fund Facility arrangement from the initially approved US$3 billion in December 2022 to US$8 billion. The IMF has consistently advocated for Egypt to implement tighter monetary policies to address nearly 30 percent inflation and adopt a more flexible official exchange rate. As part of the agreement, Egypt committed to reducing spending on large government projects.  – Business Insider Africa "

This takes Congo one step closer to completing an IMF programme for the first time.  Previous agreements have been derailed by issues including a lack of transparency in its vast mining sector. “Performance under the (three-year) program has been generally positive, with most quantitative objectives met and key reforms implemented, albeit at a slow pace,” the Fund said in a statement. Once approved by the IMF board, the agreement will allow for the disbursement of a final tranche of around US$200 million. The IMF noted that the world’s top supplier of cobalt – the mineral used in smartphones – and the third-largest producer of copper must account for the positive impact of a recently amended Sicomines joint venture with Chinese companies in its revised budget law for 2024. “In addition, mechanisms will need to be put in place or reinforced to ensure the proper use and governance of these funds,” the Fund said. President Felix Tshisekedi pushed for the revision of the 2008 infrastructure for minerals deal with Sinohydro Corp and China Railway Group to bring more benefits for Congo. An agreement was signed in March. “The IMF is concerned about the mechanisms for using this money and has asked for it to be paid into the public treasury accounts rather than being managed by an agency as has been done in the past,” a finance ministry official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters. – The East African "
https://www.herald.co.zw/sa-vehicle-industry-achieves-r21bn-positive-trade-balance/,SA vehicle industry achieves R21bn positive trade balance,"Record vehicle exports helped take South Africa’s car trade balance to a positive R21,1 billion in 2023 from R19,6 billion in 2022 – an increase of 7,6 percent. Norman Lamprecht, chief trade and research officer at motor vehicle business council Naamsa, said on Tuesday vehicle exports have remained the key driver for the automotive industry’s healthy trade balance since 2008. “Despite a constrained economic environment undermining the domestic new vehicle market’s ability to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, record-high vehicle exports ensured that the automotive industry outperformed the rest of the manufacturing sector,” he said. “As the largest manufacturing sector in the country’s economy, a substantial 21,9 percent of value addition within the domestic manufacturing output was derived from vehicle and automotive component manufacturing in 2023, while the broader automotive industry’s contribution to the GDP comprised 5,3 percent – 3,2 percent manufacturing and 2,1 percent retail.” The industry has now achieved a positive trade balance since 2015, according to the annual Automotive Trade Manual, previously named the Automotive Export Manual, which was released this week. However, the motor vehicle trade balance figures exclude aftermarket parts, which recorded a negative trade balance of R99,5 billion in 2023. Automotive export revenue grew by 19,1 percent to a record R270,8 billion in 2023 from R227,3 billion in 2022. Lamprecht said this could mainly be attributed to a record vehicle export performance, resulting in vehicle export revenue increasing by 29,9 percent to R203,9 billion in 2023 from R157 billion in 2022. He said automotive component exports decreased by 4,8 percent to R66,9 billion in 2023 from R70,3 billion in 2022, which is in line with lower catalytic converter exports. The value of automotive imports increased by 20.2 percent to R249,7 billion in 2023 from R207,7 billion in 2022. Lamprecht attributed this mainly to the 34,3 percent year-on-year increase in the imports of original equipment components in 2023, which was to accommodate new model launches by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the domestic market. Lamprecht said the objectives of the South African Automotive Masterplan (SAAM) 2021-2035 are to increase vehicle production to 1.4 million vehicles per annum by 2035 and raise localisation levels in SA-manufactured vehicles from an average of 40 percent to 60 percent by 2035, which will contribute to decreasing reliance on imported components in the future. Exports to the EU, the domestic automotive industry’s top export region, increased to a record R147,1 billion in 2023, while exports to Africa, its second-largest export region, rose to a record R42,8 billion. Lamprecht said given the high export exposure of the domestic automotive industry to the EU, legislation to ban the sale of new internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the EU and UK by 2035 requires a speedy approach because of the required timeframe within which SA’s automotive industry must respond to this challenge. – Moneyweb "

https://www.herald.co.zw/govt-applauds-natfoods-efforts-in-cutting-imports/,Govt applauds NatFoods efforts in cutting imports,"Michael Tome–Business Reporter THE Government has commended National Foods Limited (NatFoods) for investing in projects expected to significantly curb the country’s high import bill. NatFoods has invested nearly US$16 million into several factory lines of production between 2023 and 2024, which is expected to go a long way in import substitution. Statistics show that imports increased by 12 percent to US$1,41 billion in the first two months of 2024 from US$1,26 billion in the same period in 2023, reflecting a trade deficit of US$234 million. NatFoods has invested in a cereal extrusion plant worth US$4,4 million, replaced a flour milling plant in Bulawayo for US$6 million and established a pasta line for US$5,6 million. Zimbabwe imports an average of US$40 million pasta annually, which the country can produce locally. NatFoods’ past plant produces about 1 200 tonnes per month against national demand of around 3 500 tonnes. Zimbabwe is also grappling with an influx of biscuits mainly from South Africa and Zambia, but investments by NatFoods could help whittle down the imports when it commissions a biscuit line later this month. Import substitution is a key priority in the National Development Strategy 1 (2021-2025) as Zimbabwe seeks to structurally transform its economy to increase manufactured value-added products. Speaking during the National Foods Stirling Workington tour, Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu said the Government was impressed by the firm’s immense contribution towards the growth of the local economy particularly the vision to import substitutes. “I think it is very important for the nation to appreciate what our business sector is doing, contributing towards the growth of our economy.  “What impresses me more is that you are targeting those products where we are spending a lot of our hard-earned foreign currency, importing. This is a very key policy position for the government, and we will be working with them to see what policy measures will be critical “In the next few months, we will be tracking to see the import substitution levels, and this calls for Government support wherever we can to ensure that we do promote import substitution,” said Minister Ndhlovu. NatFoods chief executive officer, Mr Michael Lashbrook said his company would remain committed to curbing importation of basic (food) commodities in the country. “We have invested heavily in these new platforms in the last three years, we have put around US$40 million into new projects, and many of these products are for import substitution. “This includes a pasta line, it is very interesting how Zimbabwe is consuming 3 500 tonnes of pasta per month, and all of our pasta at the moment is imported, there are no pasta plants in Zimbabwe, but we can produce all the pasta needed in the country with potential to export. “Currently, we can produce about 1 200 tonnes per month, so we can fulfill about a third of the national demand, we have currently put technology for macaroni, spaghetti is a different technology that we look forward to installing. Most of Zimbabwe’s pasta is sourced from Egypt and Mozambique. “We are in the process of establishing a US$7,7 million biscuit plant, it is crazy that we import a lot of biscuits from South Africa and Zambia, why don’t we make them here, because again biscuits are in essence flour, sugar, and a bit of fat which we locally have, we should be producing those locally,” he said. “We are saying this is crazy because we are surplus producers of wheat as a country, pasta is basically wheat flour and water. Why are we as a country importing pasta when there is raw material locally? He said we have managed to fund these with our resources and we are very excited this is going "
