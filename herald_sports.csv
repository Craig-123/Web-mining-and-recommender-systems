https://www.herald.co.zw/chevrons-get-consolation-t20i-win/,Chevrons get consolation T20I win,"Zimpapers Sports Hub ZIMBABWE’S over-reliance on the batting of captain Sikandar Raza was cruelly exposed in the just ended five-match T20 International series against hosts, Bangladesh. An eight-wicket win with nine balls to spare in the final game yesterday ensured that Zimbabwe put something on the board and avoided a humiliating series whitewash. Zimbabwe’s consolation victory coincided with the first match Raza scored runs. The Chevrons’ T20I skipper flopped in the opening four matches and Zimbabwe found themselves starring a series whitewash going into yesterday’s match. All four defeats were a result of Zimbabwe batsmen, especially Raza and the top order, failing to score runs. When Raza got it right, Zimbabwe lost just two wickets chasing 158. After winning the toss, Raza sent Bangladesh to bat and the hosts made 157/6 off their 20 overs with a topscore of 54 from Mohammad Mahmudullah while Bennett claimed two wickets for 20 in three overs and Blessing Muzarabani taking two for 22 in four overs. Mahmudullah took to the crease with Bangladesh struggling at 15 for 3 and he used the opportunity to push for a solid role in Bangladesh’s team for the ICC T20 World Cup. Mahmudullah shared a 69-run fourth wicket stand with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, who made 36. In reply, Zimbabwe lost Tadiwanashe Marumani for one in the fifth over. Raza was unbeaten on 72 runs off 46 balls when victory was achieved while opener Brian Bennett was named player-of-the-match for 70 runs in 49 balls with the bat and the two wickets for 20 with the  ball. Raza and Bennett featured in a 75-run partnership for the second wicket while the skipper and Jonathan Campbell were unbeaten on 45 in a third wicket stand when victory was achieved. Bennett believes yesterday’s victory should be a good foundation for the future as a number of young players join the Chevrons. “Very grateful for today. We came close in the last game but I am really happy for the team to go back with a victory, obviously not what you want from the series but a good effort from the team today. We have been backed and supported by the coaching staff. We have few youngsters in the team so I think we still have some time so let’s see what happens in the future,” he said. Raza was relieved to have finally found a solution to the batting nightmare. “It’s nice to go home with a win. Like we said in the last three games we were working our way closer and closer to the victory margin. It’s nice to contribute. In the last presentation I came here and said the only jigsaw puzzle that’s missing is me scoring runs. “If I can contribute towards the succession of the team it will give me immense pleasure. And today is one of those days. It’s always nice to contribute towards the winning of the side. When we were losing on those little margins, I thought that was on me. But Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God). “A lot of positives, I lost the series 4-1 but I can say that a lot of positives and we have something to work on for the future of the T20I cricket for Zimbabwe. I am very proud of the squad and I am sure these young guns will take Zimbabwe forward.” "
https://www.herald.co.zw/hollick-crowned-fbc-zim-open-champ/,Hollick crowned FBC Zim Open champ,"Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter GOLFER Michael Hollick kicked off his birthday week in style after he beat a strong field to lift the 2024 FBC Zimbabwe Open Golf championship for the first time at Royal Harare yesterday afternoon. Hollick, who turns 37 on Wednesday, needed to summon all his golf prowess yesterday to finish with a 20-under-par 268 after an epic final day against South African compatriot Darren Fichardt, who pushed him to the limit with his 18-under-par 270. Zimbabwe’s top professional Scott Vincent was in third place with a respectable 14-under after a feisty last two days on the greens. His brother Kieran Vincent also put up a commendable show, tied for fourth place with Swedish golfer Frederick From. Another Zimbabwean Ben Follett-Smith was sixth on 11-under while highly rated Zimbabwean golf prodigy Matthew Bramford, was the top amateur after finishing on 38th place with a course par score 288. But as has become the norm, it was the South African golfers who dominated the event. Hollick, who won his second Sunshine Tour title with the FBC Zimbabwe Open success, was excited to be on the winning podium, six years after he last participated in the Harare event. “It’s always amazing to be here. I haven’t been here since Covid-19, so coming back was nice and the golf course hasn’t changed in the last five years. “It’s always brilliant from the first time I played here in 2011. So I am very pleased,” he said. The 36-year-old had to hold off competition from compatriot Fichardt with six birdies for his final round 66. Hollick had a one-stroke lead going into the final round after he had followed up his first two rounds of 66 and 67 with an impressive 68 in the third round on Saturday, leaving him on 15-under-par. He had a bogey on the 11th hole but the script still went his way yesterday with a crucial birdie in the 17th as Fichardt was dented by two bogeys on the second and 11th holes, despite also carding six birdies on the final day. “It was great,” said Hollick. “I have been lucky enough to play a lot of tournament golf with Darren over the years and he is one hell of a player. So I knew he wasn’t going to give it to me today and I had to go out and win it. Fortunately, I had the goods and I produced it in the end. “And, the biggest thanks go to the fans here; to the crowd that was out, here thank you so much. You really make the most incredible environment for us to play. “I also want to thank Royal Harare Golf Club for hosting us. The golf course was absolutely amazing and I can’t thank you guys enough. “I also want to thanks Darren Fichardt, it was a hell of a battle today. We had a good go out there and well-played,” said Hollick. For the umpteenth time, the Zimbabwe Open Golf title evaded the locals who were left waiting for their breakthrough 24 years since Mark McNulty became the last Zimbabwean to win it in 2000. Scott Vincent reignited Zimbabwe’s hopes for the better part of yesterday but his five-under 67 was not enough to give the top two South Africans a jolt as he settled in third place. His brother Kieran had started the day as the best placed Zimbabwean on 11-under par but he failed to continue with the momentum from the previous day. Bogies on the eighth, 10th and 13th holes came at a huge cost for the younger Vincent. Scott Vincent said the course was tough and will try again next year to challenge for the Zimbabwe Open. “The Sunshine Tour is always strong,” he said. “They always play really tough and obviously it’s good to have them come here and play and it was fun to play JC Ritchie. He is a fantastic player, he played on the world stage. “So all in all it’s a strong field and it’s good to be here. I would love to come back and play every year. We have just to see the scheduling and how it all works out,” said Scott Vincent. Sunshine Tour tournament director Gary Todd was thrilled by the successful hosting of the R2.5 million FBC Holdings-sponsored event. “On behalf of the Sunshine Tour I can’t thank FBC Holdings enough, it was such a fantastic event. “It would be rude of me not to mention the Royal Harare Golf Club course staff who have preserved the facility this week in the most outstanding condition. “To the people of Harare, who have come out and supported us during this magical week, I can’t believe it has gone so quickly and we won’t see you for another year, it’s too long,” said Todd.

There were three bubbles in place with Harare District dominating in the capital, ZDF walking tall in Masvingo while Harare City showed class in Marondera. But it was ZDF who stole the show in Masvingo where hordes of fans made their way to witness top-tier netball spectacle in their town for the first time. Inspired by Gems Goal Shooter Sharon Bwanali, ZDF put newcomers St P&P to the cleaners in a 142-7 punishing scoreline. They had been stretched to their last gear by rivals Black Rhinos who they finally managed to beat 54-41 in the bubble’s tightest duel. Without former champions Platinum Queens and Ngezi Platinum who have reportedly disbanded as well as Greenfuel whose fate is still unknown, ZDF could be just on their way to winning the title though it’s still early days yet. Bwanali, who was mobbed by Masvingo fans who were used to seeing her on television said ZDF need to stay grounded. “We might be on top of the situation and on top of everyone but we need to be cautious and remain focused,” she said. “Last year we finished fourth and we need to change that. “We know there are so many teams like Harare District, Black Rhinos and, Stormers, Harare City, who are doing well and can challenge us at the top so we need to keep on working very hard.” In Marondera, Harare City beat Waterfalls 70-16 before they accounted for Zupco 55-33 in another exciting game while Stormers also came out unscathed when dismissing Waterfalls 62-29 and Marondera 62-28. Harare District were the toast of the capital beating High Fliers 45-32 while Mutare City dismissed 7Flames 49-37 in the same bubble.

Early goals by FC Platinum, that came in  a flash, inside 10 minutes was all that separated the teams. FC Platinum opened the scoring in two minutes of play through Juan Mutudza, who positioned himself well to finish off a coordinated passage of play. Highlanders’s defence was caught off guard and exposed their goalkeeper, Raphael Pitisi, who dived the wrong way and let in a beauty of a shot. In the opening five minutes, Highlanders tried to raid the platinum miners with fast-paced attcks but the visitors’ defence was alert, shutting out the efforts. FC Platinum had the first corner, just in 10 minutes of play, Mutudza curled it and Lawrence Mhlanga rose high and nodded the second goal. That is all FC Platinum needed to collect maximum points. Highlanders were not in their usual form and the trusted defensive line,  led by captain Peter Muduhwa, was porous. After the second goal, Bosso attempted to regain composure and Mvelo Khoza’s thunderbolt went wide. Godfrey Makaruse, who was drafted in to replace Archford Faira, was fouled on the left lank by Hagiazo Magaya. However, Mbeba skied the free-kick. Bosso’s first corner came in the 30th minute. Prince Ndlovu took the kick but found no takers at goal. Another corner kick came and Andrew Mbeba was trusted to pass it through, instead, the ball was blocked by Platinum’ Rainsome Pavari. For Highlanders, the absence of the ever creative Melikhaya Ncube, who was serving a one-match suspension, was felt. At the 37th minute, Bosso had the chance to reply but McKinnon Mushore’s shot hit the upright post, with the rebound landing on Prince Ndlovu’s boots but he shot wide. In the opening 15 minutes of the second half, Highlanders had opportunities to hit back but Lynoth Chikuhwa fluffed them, while FC Platinum could have netted their third goal through Hagiazo Magaya. In the end, Kaindu rued the absence of Melikhaya. “We were unsettled in the first 10 minutes that we conceded two goals and it is always difficult to come back, especially against a team like FC Platinum. I think Melikhaya’s absence could have affected us. “We didn’t convert chances that came our way. Our opponents scored utilised the chances they got. Even in the second half we looked a bit stronger but unfortunately we couldn’t get the goals in terms of converting the chances that we had created. FC Platinum coach, Norman Mapeza, was a happy man. He was honest enough to say he did not expect the victory, given Bosso’s legacy at Barbourfields and their record so far. “It was a good game of football. I said it before, it was all to do with controlling the game in the opening minutes and that’s exactly what we did. We had some good opportunities to increase the lead. Overall it was a good game,” said Mapeza. “I told the guys that in the first 15 minutes they were going to come at us. It worked well as we needed to defend with four players at the back and made sure there were no crosses coming in between. Well done to my boys, they did exactly what we did at training,” said Mapeza. Teams: Highlanders: R. Pitisi, D. Mhindirira (Chigonero 66 minutes) , L. Chikuhwa, M. Mushore, P. Ndlovu, G.

Blessing Ngazima and Gift Mwinga scored the goals that broke the home team fans’ hearts. The Gweru Premiership returnees have not won a game in their last six outings and the fans feel the team has disappointed after garnering 11 points from as many games. After the game yesterday, the irate TelOne supporters assembled outside the dressing rooms and had to be dispersed by the police who calmed the situation. Chikuni blamed his team for the defeat, but the fans’ reaction was a clear indication that they were disappointed with his performance. On the other hand, Chegutu Pirates coach Emmanuel Day Gutu breathed a sigh of relief as his team scored a goal in each half. The Premiership newboys marched into Bata Stadium with the sole aim of proving themselves as a force to be reckoned with. They got an early goal from a free kick in the fifth minute after Reginald Ngazima was fouled just outside the box. Gift Mwinga stepped up and curled a brilliant shot that beat TelOne goalkeeper Matshazi Thabiso all systems out. TelOne piled on the pressure in search of an equaliser with their star man Blessing Sahondo leading the quest but their found the Pirates defence that was well marshalled by Reuben Machaya in an uncompromising mood. After the half-time break, visiting coach Gutu introduced Russel Chifura, Tinotenda Ditima and Tinashe Mavhudzi to add flair to his side. The trio gelled immaculately, supplying a neat pass to Cleopas Dube who complemented it with an impish low header to increase the tally midway through the second half. After the final whistle, an elated Gutu gave credit to his players for the tough away win. “I’m a relieved man. As you can see, we were sitting in a precarious position on the league table.” “The win is a real boost as we are travelling to face Bikita Minerals away next week.” Gutu expressed gratitude towards their loyal supporters who have been with the team in every match, regardless of their performance.

https://www.herald.co.zw/nakambas-luton-concede-epl-demotion/,Nakamba’s Luton concede EPL demotion,"LONDON. — Injured Warriors captain, Marvelous Nakamba will resume action in the English Championship after his Luton Town lasted just one season in the English Premiership. Nakamba was ruled out for the rest of the season following injury in December and was not able to help the club survive relegation, which was virtually confirmed on Saturday. Luton Town boss Rob Edwards said the Premier League was “just a bit too much” for his side after a 3-1 loss away at West Ham United all but sealed his team’s relegation. Luton have struggled to find their feet in their first season in England’s top flight since 1992, having won just one in 16 in the league, and not registered an away league win in 2024. “We didn’t get relegated because of today, it was a culmination of the whole season. Today was the difficult day but we’ve been on an incredible journey. I’m just really disappointed that I’m the one responsible,” he told reporters. Edwards praised his side’s performance in the first half, where Luton went into the break 1-0 up thanks to a sixth-minute header from Belgian midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga. “We showed some really good things to go 1-0 up . . . we showed at times we’ve got quality to get behind them and get into good areas,” he told reporters. West Ham’s quality proved too much for the Hatters in the second half, and a much-improved performance from the home side saw goals from James Ward-Prowse, Tomas Soucek and George Earthy dealt a hammer blow to Luton’s hopes of survival. “Credit to them, they’ve got some really good players and we came up short,” Edwards added. Luton were not officially relegated on Saturday after Nottingham Forest lost 3-2 to Chelsea, but it will take a final day miracle for them to survive. They host Fulham on the final day of the season needing to overcome a three point and 12 goal-difference deficit to 17th placed Forest, who visit already relegated Burnley. Luton have won the respect of rival teams and fans alike this season with their style of play and approach, having risen all the way from the Conference — England’s fifth tier — in the last 10 years to achieve a place in the Premier League for this season. West Ham fans applauded Luton’s players off the pitch at the end of the match, which Edwards said was “touching”. “At times I think we’ve shown that we can compete with loads of teams, with everybody, and the growth and the improvement, I take pride in that,” he said. “I’ve loved it, and it fuels the fire to get back in.” Luton have struggled to compete financially with other teams in the Premier League this year and have spent far less than any other club according to Transfermarket. “We got promoted with one of the smallest budgets… It was a huge gap, chasm, between us and the Premier League. That won’t necessarily be the case now, we can be one of the stronger teams.” With Sheffield United and Burnley already relegated, it would be the first time since the 1997-1998 season that all three promoted teams go straight back down. Edwards said they wanted to go out in style against Fulham on the final day. “We want to try and go out on a high and show the best us, we owe that to our supporters, ourselves, and the league.” —Reuters/Sports Reporter.

(0) 1 Bikita Minerals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   0 MANICA Diamonds eased to the summit of the Castle Lager Premiership table after winning their seventh match on the trot, this time a 1-0 win over Bikita Minerals at Sakubva Stadium yesterday. Impressive Micheal Tapera’s 66th minute strike, his fifth goal in as many matches, was all the diamond miners needed to dismiss their opponents in this pulsating encounter that had all the ingredients of a derby.  In fact, the consistent Manica Diamonds left winger has been the main man behind Manica Diamonds’ resurgence, with his second half introduction, together with Charles Teguru on the right, proving too hot to handle for most of their opponents.  The fast-paced encounter started with both teams showing exuberance by creating scoring opportunities. First off the blocks were the lithium miners in the second minute when exciting Chris Makambira was floored just outside the box. Right back, Blessing Kagudu made a mess of the resultant free kick as he directed his effort into the left side netting. The hosts also had a clear cut scoring chance two minutes later when a flat footed yet rightly positioned Panashe Mutasa got to the end of neat exchange of passes but blasted the ball way over the cross bar from close range. The Gem Boys, as Manica Diamonds are fondly referred to by their growing legion of fans, almost surged ahead five minutes after the breather when Micheal Tapera latched on to a loose ball off a rebound and his blistering shot hit the crossbar while an already beaten Bikita Minerals goalkeeper Victor Machopa remained motionless. Tapera was back to torment the visiting side two minutes later when he ghosted from the right to connect Charles Teguru’s cross, but his header missed the target by inches. However, Manica Diamonds finally broke the deadlock in the 64th minute when Fortune Binzi tapped the ball to an unmarked Tapera’s in the box and the later made no mistake as he blasted the ball home to give the hosts the lead. Manica Diamonds coach Tapera acknowledged that the pressure is mounting with each match they continue collecting maximum points. “We have been on a winning streak, and that makes each match more challenging given that every opponent that we now face ups the tempo. “Nonetheless, that is the nature of the game. It comes with pressure with each outing and we just have to compete. I believe so far so good, we have been competing well and we hope to continue collecting maximum points as we go,” said Tapera.  The Manica Diamonds gaffer praised his men for a decent performance. “I am happy with the way we have been defending in all these matches we have won. We have kept a clean sheet and that is commendable. “On the transition to attack, we have also been impressive and that explains the rhythm in our play. It is flowing very well and we will work towards maintaining that,” he said. Bikita Minerals coach Saul Chaminuka was an angry man after the final whistle. The veteran gaffer, who is widely believed to be on his way to Green Fuel this week to take over the role of head coach where he will be assisted by Taurai Mangwiro, was not happy with the match officiating. “There is no way we can develop as a nation in this game with this kind of match officiating. Surely, my players being kicked, even in off the ball situations, but the referee waves play on. It is unfortunate that we coaches when we complain about referees, we are crucified, so I will not comment about this match,” fumed Chaminuka.

Sibanda, who has previously made waves in the Mighty Warriors dugout, showed some clout when leading FC Platinum Royals to a strong finish last season. And she is expected to finally end Chapungu Queens’ wait for a maiden title this season. But she will have to reorganise her charges after they failed to work out a formula to repel champions Herentals Queens, who made history by winning the crown without suffering any defeat last season. The tie was the pick of the league’s opening weekend and it lived up to its billing, with both teams displaying quality in a match that attracted a lot of spectators. Herentals Queens, after missing some good chances just like their opponents in the opening phase, came good through the boot of 2022 Soccer Star of the Year Praynance Zvawanda in the second half. Though Chapungu Queens tried hard to crawl back with the fit-again Ethel Chinyerere rattling the cross-bar, the Simbarashe Dedza side held on to start the defence of their title on a positive note. Sibanda though noted some good signs from her team which she hopes to build ftom going into match day two of the championship. “Herentals are a big team and we are fighting to be in the top there. The aspirations have never changed. “It was a very good game, very physical. I noted a lot of positives from my team,” said Sibanda. “We need to work on some slight things like concentration especially analysing how we conceded. We were winning the second ball and really played well. We just need to make sure that we play well. “This is a marathon, there are still a lot of games to play and a lot of things to fix. We have a very strong squad and we are looking forward to doing well.” Dedza, whose girls will be representing the country in the Women’s CAF Champions League Zonal qualifiers in South Africa in August, said the Students need to maintain the winning spirit. “Chapungu is a very strong team but my girls showed a lot of character,” Dedza said. “This is a long marathon and we need to keep on having the right mentality that helps us get the results.” Elsewhere, Shamaine Kapachi hauled four goals to help FC Platinum Royals dispatch MSU Queens 7-0, while Greater Bhande, Chiedza Paraganda and Kudakwashe Basopo grabbed a hattrick each to help their teams to comfortable wins. Bhande got three goals in Black Rhinos’ 7-0 win over ZRP Harare, with Paraganda’s triple strikes seeing Conduit sprint over the line against Hope Academy in a 5-0 victory for the Guruve team.

Far side assistant referee Kudzanai Hiya, who flagged Herentals’ Dreamer Liye’s opener for offside with 27 minutes on the clock, again raised his flag when Donald Dzvinyai appeared to have secured the points for Dynamos. With DeMbare players sprinting to celebrate and later confront Hiya, Herentals quickly started play and as they were going clear of goal, the Dynamos bench, led by goalkeepers’ coach Britto Gwere rushed into the pitch to curtail the attack. Apart from the controversy of disallowed goals, the  ‘dirty’ match was characterised by crude tackles and every aspect of tension. After missing an array of chances in the opening half hour, Nomore Chinyerere broke the ice with a fortuitous finish, benefiting largely from poor goalkeeping by Takudzwa Chikosi, who fumbled the tame effort letting it slide in between his legs, with 31 minutes played. With the Glamour Boys tiding things up to the break, they had no answers to the Students’ raids, with substitute Milton Chimedza coming to the end of Tino Benza’s cross after 66 minutes. Dynamos gaffer Genesis Mangombe decried his team’s failure to utilise their opportunities. “We should try and make sure that we score goals whenever we get chances. I think we got so many chances in the first half, but we failed to score,” said Mangombe. “Some of these decisions are costing us at the end of the day, but I am not a referee. “If it’s a goal, it’s a goal. Even in their (Herentals) goal, I thought there was an infringement on Jalai (Emmanuel). “We scored a clear goal, but it was disallowed.” His Herentals counterpart, Paul Benza, said he was not qualified to comment about match officiating although Liyeto’s first half goal appeared to be legitimate. “I don’t qualify to comment about match officials,” said Benza. “The game was good and I thought my players did very well. “I am happy and disappointed at the same time. I think we should have won this match but it is some of those things that happen in football. “But the fighting spirit from my lads was amazing.” Dynamos should have opened the scoring inside 19 minutes but Elton Chikona failed to direct his effort well when shrugging his markers inside the box. Five minutes later, Donald Mudadi managed a low shot but it was parried away by Chikosi.  Herentals took their points tally to 11 while DeMbare are now on 12 points, eight behind leaders Manica Diamonds.

Leandro Trossard scored the only goal on 20 minutes as Arsenal won for just the second time in 17 games away at United to go a point clear at the summit. Manchester City still have the destiny of the title in their own hands as the defending champions have two matches left to Arsenal’s one. However, the Gunners kept the pressure on Pep Guardiola’s men ahead of their tricky trip to Tottenham on Tuesday. Defeat further dented United’s chances of competing in Europe next season. Erik ten Hag’s men showed more spirit than in a dismal 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday, but have now won just one of their last eight Premier League games. United remain eighth in the table, three points adrift of both Newcastle, who they face on Wednesday, and Chelsea. Arsenal have been in scintillating form in 2024 to remain in the race for their first league title in 20 years. Mikel Arteta’s men have won 15 and drawn one of their 17 league games since the turn of the year. But Arsenal were far from their flowing best as the expected onslaught of an injury-ravaged United never materialised under unusually stifling heat in England’s north-west. The manner of defeat at Palace had increased the scrutiny on United boss Ten Hag. He made three changes to the team swept aside at Selhurst Park as Scott McTominay, Sofyan Amrabat and Amad Diallo came in. The Dutchman’s options were again hamstrung by a lengthy list of absentees with captain Bruno Fernandes among those sidelined and a bench littered with youngsters. But his decision to retain Casemiro as a makeshift centre-back after his woeful showing against Palace will become another stick to beat the beleaguered coach with. The Brazil captain was dropped from their squad for the Copa America in midweek due to his terrible form. After United had managed to keep the free-scoring visitors at bay for the opening 20 minutes, Casemiro was culpable for the opening goal. The 32-year-old was laboured in pushing up from a United goal-kick to play Kai Havertz onside and Trossard then stole in on the blind side of Casemiro to tap in the German’s cross. United’s new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance at Old Trafford rather than at Wembley to see the club’s women pick up their first ever major trophy in the FA Cup final. The work that lies ahead of Ratcliffe has been laid bare in recent weeks, but the home side did manage to keep the majority of the 74 000 crowd onside by taking the game to Arsenal after the break. Arsenal, though, were rarely seriously troubled as they held out for a sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games. Alejandro Garnacho was United’s one live wire but smashed into the side-netting with his best chance to equalise. Gabriel Martinelli and Declan Rice were denied by brilliant Andre Onana saves to prevent Arsenal the second goal they craved to avoid a tense finale. The visitors desperation to see the game out was evident as Martinelli took the ball to the corner with 10 minutes of the 90 still to play. But Arsenal did just enough to ask the question City, who host West Ham on the final day of the season after their visit to north London in midweek. — SuperSport. "

https://www.herald.co.zw/legendary-zim-duo-shines-at-cosafa-awards/,Legendary Zim duo shines at COSAFA awards,"Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN players and officials may not have won any awards at the at the inaugural COSAFA awards in South Africa on Thursday but the country was represented on the podium by legendary former Warriors coach Sunday ‘Mhofu’ Chidzambwa and ex-referee Felix Tangawarima who were honoured with Lifetime Achievement Awards by the Southern African football body. Chidzambwa, who is the most successful coach in COSAFA Cup, was presented with a Lifetime Achievement in Services to Coaching while Tangawarima’s efforts were acknowledged with the Lifetime Achievement in Services to Refereeing. Coming just a few years after retiring from active coaching, Chidzambwa should have found great cheer from the recognition as it is not every day that local officials get such recognition for their efforts. The 72-year-old coach has made extraordinary accomplishments in the COSAFA Cup, where he has won a record four titles and never lost a match outright. The former Dynamos and Zimbabwe captain and coach lifted the COSAFA Cup in 2003, 2009 on home soil and the 2017 and 2018 editions in Rustenburg and Polokwane, South Africa respectively. Only two other coaches, his late young brother Misheck in 2000 and Charles Mhlauri (2005) have ed Zimbabwe to COSAFA glory. Zimbabwe’s six titles are only second to Zambia who hold the record with seven and that is thanks largely to the mentorship of Chidzambwa, who has never been beaten outright in the COSAFA Cup after leading Zimbabwe in 19 matches in the tournament. The veteran coach has been keeping a low profile since he quit his job as Warriors coach in 2019, and from active football coaching a year later. However, the former defender briefly bounced back for a once-off assignment when he led the Warriors against Namibia during the celebrations to mark President Mnangagwa’s inauguration last year. Previously he had several stints with the national team and holds the distinction of being the first to lead the Warriors to their maiden Africa Cup of Nations in 2004. He guided the team to the tournament again in Egypt in 2019. The 72-year-old mentor raked several trophies with Dynamos at the height of his caching career and took the popular club to the final of the 1998 CAF Champions League. It remains the only time that a local club has reached the final of a continental club competition. Tangawarima, a revered figure across the African refereeing fraternity, has done much to develop match officials on the African continent in the last few decades, but especially Southern Africa, and was awarded with a Lifetime Achievement for services to refereeing. Tangawarima, who is now as a CAF senior referees’ instructor, has worked extensively for the development of the refereeing standards in Eastern and Southern Africa. A deeply religious man, Tangawarima paid tribute to his family and his United Methodist Church members for standing by him in long career as a match official. “I would want to thank COSAFA for bestowing me with this prestigious award. “I have all been passionate about doing my job, especially developing and leading the referees throughout the entire continent,’’ Tangawarima said. “But being recognised in this manner is something I will always cherish for years to come. “Again, I would want to thank Zimbabweans in general for the support they have given me over all these years. “Sometimes, they may not know what it means to me when they talk positive things about how I do my work. It always encourages me to continue working hard so that I don’t let them down. “My family has also been a pillar of my strength. “My football family in Zimbabwe and the football association, I cannot do this without belonging to the mother body (ZIFA). “My colleagues at my church Inner City United Methodist Church for all the prayer session they do for me.’’. Tangwawarima said he also felt even more honoured to receive the award in the presence of the Sports and Recreation Commission and the ZIFA Normalisation Committee leadership. “I was humbled to have the chairman of the SRC (Gerald Mlotshwa), the director-general (Eltah Nengomasha), together with commissioners Nigel Munyati and others, the NC chairman Mr Lincoln Mutasa, witnessing the occasion and taking pictures with me, this gave me a huge sense of belonging and being loved. “I also thank the media for always highlighting the work I would have done, which resulted in me getting this award. “I am sure this award will inspire upcoming sportspersons to know that they can do it, with hard work and commitment.’’ Some of the local referees and coaches who have been found wanting in their duties could probably take a leaf from each of Chudzambwa and Tangawarima’s success stories. The awards night, however, belonged mainly to the players and coaches who walked home with various accolades. Held for the first time in the history of COSAFA, the ceremony at the exquisite Sandton Convention Centre on Thursday drew some of the luminaries of the game from this part of the continent and was a platform to celebrate success in 2023. South African striker Percy Tau and Zambian forward Racheal Kundananji took home the best player prizes at the inaugural awards, itself a glittering gala ceremony. COSAFA executive director Sue Destombes said the organisation was proud to have finally put together an event to acknowledge the talent in Southern Africa. “These awards have been a long time coming as we felt there is the need to celebrate our successes as a region and show the togetherness and spirit of Ubuntu that we have among all our COSAFA nations. “We have enormous talent on and off the pitch and while we do acknowledge these winners for their outstanding contributions, we also recognise that there is much more for us to do to unlock the full potential we possess in Southern Africa,” said Destombes.

https://www.herald.co.zw/mapeza-pleads-for-patience-with-refs-ahead-of-bosso-tie/,Mapeza pleads for patience with refs ahead of Bosso tie,"Onward Gangata FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza has pleaded with the local football community to be patient with referees ahead of his side’s top of the table clash against Highlanders at Barbourfields tomorrow. There have been growing concerns over the decline in the standards of match officiating in the local game. In acts of misconduct that only serve to shame the Premiership, two matches have so far been abandoned due to crowd trouble and teams protesting referees’ decisions. FC Platinum’s clash against CAPS United at Mandava was abandoned in the 86th minute with the miners leading 1-0. Mapeza’s men were eventually awarded the points via a disciplinary committee ruling that also slapped CAPS United with a US$4000 fine. Chegutu Pirates have been summoned to a hearing by the PSL following the abandonment of their match against Dynamos at Baobab where the newboys refused to let the game restart as they protested an injury-time goal scored by DeMbare. For all the attacks levelled against the referees, Mapeza, has, however, come out in defence of the match officials. The Zimbabwe skipper and coach, who last year threatened to quit the game over biased officiating, urged patience with the match officials. He argued that the game’s stakeholders needed to also understand that referees are prone to mistakes “like any other humans’’ and that the errors are part of the game. “Everybody should know that in a game of football you win, you lose and you draw,’’ said Mapeza. “Whatever the referees are going to do let us respect that, otherwise if we are not going to respect the referees then there are going to be problems.’’ An explosive encounter is on the cards after FC Platinum eased into third place and a point behind leaders and Manica Diamonds who both have 19 points. Depending on how Manica Diamonds fare in the Eastern Region derby clash with Bikita Minerals, FC Platinum could go top should they overcome Bosso. Mapeza pleaded with the fans, especially, to exercise restraint when protesting referees’ decisions. And Mapeza pleaded with the supporters that even when match officials make grave mistakes, supporters must always exercise restraint. “We have to respect the referees…we saw what happened in that match between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich and was there any crowd trouble? No! “Why can’t we learn from that “Referees are also human, they make mistakes and we should accept that, if we really love our football, we should respect referees’ decisions.’’ Mapeza said. "
https://www.herald.co.zw/beitbridge-community-pins-psl-hopes-on-dulibadzimu/,Beitbridge community pins PSL hopes on Dulibadzimu,"Curtworth Masango THE Beitbridge community is hoping to have one of their local teams bounce back into top-flight football after a lengthy period in the lower leagues. Clubs like Border Strikers, Under Hill, and Triple B altogether have had a dance in the PSL before they found themselves relegated to the lower leagues. Now, if the form that has been displayed by Dulibadzimu in ZIFA Central Region Soccer League is anything to go by, the Beitbridge community is hoping they might be having top-flight football back in their community soon. After six games, Dulibadzimu, who are under the guidance of Stanley Ncube, are in pole position with 16 points, four points clear second-placed Dinson Mvuma. Their impressive run consists of five wins and a draw. They are hoping to continue with their unbeaten run tomorrow when they face Blanket Mine away at Long John. In their last encounter, Dulibadzimu edged one of the favourites, Chapungu, by a goal to nil to make a strong case of themselves. But for Dulibadzimu chairman, Ephart Chikweza Shoko, the team is just focusing on improving their game and finish in a better position than they did last season, anything above that is a bonus for them. The club finished sixth last season with TelOne being crowned champions. “As a team, our target is to improve from what we did last season. We finished in position six and we are aiming to finish in a better position this season,” said Shoko. “Honestly, if we gain PSL status, that will be a bonus for us as we are not favourites in this marathon. But it’s best for us to maintain the position if possible, the whole football community of Beitbridge will be happy as it has been long since we have had a team from here in the top-flight. We all remember the past, it was good having our teams playing in PSL and we want to have that feeling again. “As a club we have a way we are doing things, we have trusted in continuity as we have kept the bulk of most of our players from last season and added a few players who we felt they might add value and I think it’s working. “So as the club’s executive of a community team we are just there to make sure that the community of Beitbridge at large is happy and we are ready to deliver what they expect from us,” he said.

https://www.herald.co.zw/chevrons-slump-to-fourth-t20i-defeat-in-bangladesh/,Chevrons slump to fourth T20I defeat in Bangladesh,"Don Makanyanga Sports Reporter IT was a case of so near yet so far away for Zimbabwe as the Chevrons lost the fourth T20I match against Bangladesh by five runs at Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur last night. The defeat left the Chevrons facing a possible whitewash as they now trail the series 4-0 ahead of the last match of the series tomorrow. After winning the toss yesterday, Zimbabwe elected to bowl first and managed to restrict the hosts to 143 runs in 19.5 overs. The bowling innings became a tale of two halves for the Chevrons, with the first 10 overs being a struggle for Sikandar Raza and his men. Bangladesh put 100 runs on the board after 12 overs without losing a wicket. But they went on to crumble as they lost 10 wickets in the last eight overs of their batting innings. The openers Tanzid Hasan Tamim and Soumya Sarkar provided the hosts with a flying start after putting 101 runs on the board. But Zimbabwe got their first wicket at the start of the 12th over when Hasan (52) was caught out by Jonathan Campbell off a Luke Jongwe delivery. Jongwe was to strike again four balls later, in the same over, dismissing Soumya Sarka (41), which also proved to be a vital wicket for the visitors. The two wickets marked the start of the collapse of the Bangladesh batting line up as they went on to lose eight more wickets for meagre returns. Jongwe bagged his third for the day with Richard Ngarava and Brian Bennet each claiming two wickets apiece while skipper Sikandar Raza and Blessing Muzarabani got a wicket each. Eventually, Bangladesh were bowled out for 143 runs. Zimbabwe had an awkward start chasing their first win in four matches, as Bennet was dismissed with the fourth ball of the innings. Raza was the next to be dismissed in the fourth over for 17 runs off 10 balls. At the half-way mark, chances for Zimbabwe’s first win still looked probable despite the setbacks, as the Chevrons stood at 58 runs for the loss of four wickets. The fourth and fifth wicket partnerships of Clive Madande and Campbell, and Ryan Burl and Campbell gave Zimbabwe some hope before a characteristic Chevrons collapse set in. Wellington Masakadza who has had a good time with the bat in the series, put up another good performance as he scored an unbeaten 19 off just eight balls. His efforts were not good enough for the Chevrons as they went on to lose the match by five runs after the tail was cleaned up for 138 runs in 19.4 overs. "
