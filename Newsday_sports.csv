                     Bennett, Raza seal consolation win for Zimbabwe
                    ","Brian Bennett's all-round show and Sikandar Raza's unbeaten 72 helped Zimbabwe seal a consolation win in the T20I series against Bangladesh. The visitors won by eight wickets in the fifth T20I to reduce the margin of the series defeat to 4-1. Bennett bossed both powerplays. He struck a breezy 70 in the chase after he took two wickets in the Bangladesh powerplay, finishing with 2-20. Raza finished the game with his first half-century on tour after four low scores. Mahmudullah's 54 kept Bangladesh in shape after they slipped to 15 for 3. It was his second half-century this year, as he strengthened his case to be part of Bangladesh's middle-order for the T20 World Cup. He shared a 69-run fourth wicket stand with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, who also showed some form with his 36. Zimbabwe's bowling, however, kept the home side in check, especially in the first few overs when they bowled two maiden overs. Bennett strikes early Bennett and Blessing Muzarabani stifled Bangladesh during powerplay. Muzarabani got Tanzid Hossain to top edge a slog in the second over, before Bennett removed Soumya Sarkar and Towhid Hridoy in successive overs. Sean Willams took the simple catch from a Soumya dab, at point. Hridoy was caught behind, unable to correctly judge the bounce of the ball as he went for the square cut. Bennett and Muzarabani also bowled a maiden each as the home side slipped to 15 for 3 in the fifth over. Mahmudullah rebuilds Mahmudullah countered Zimbabwe's dominance with three fours in the first four balls he faced. He started with a sweep, before hitting Bennett for a cover drive and finishing with a slice through point. He added 69 runs for the fourth wicket with Najmul Hossain Shanto. Luke Jongwe dropped Shanto on 25 at short third-man after the batter miscued a hoick against Wellington Masakadza. Shanto slammed Masakadza for his first six but his attempt at a repeat off the next ball went straight to Ryan Burl at deep midwicket. Mahmudullah launched Bennett over long-on for his only six, as he added 39 runs with Shakib Al Hasan for the fifth wicket. Johnathan Campbell's brilliant running catch from deep midwicket cut short Shakib's 17-ball 21, before Muzarabani had Mahmudullah caught at cover for 54. Bennett cracks on After impressing with the ball, Bennett got Zimbabwe off to a flyer with the bat. He struck Mahedi Hasan for two fours in the first over. He then smacked Mahedi for two sixes and a four in his next over, before hammering Saifuddin for two more fours in the fourth over. Shakib getting Marumani stumped in the fifth over slowed down Zimbabwe before Raza slammed Saifuddin over midwicket for his first six. Bennett went past his previous best in T20Is with a six off Rishad Hossain, before reaching his fifty in the 12th over. He struck two more sixes to take his tally to five sixes, before holing out to Saifuddin for 70 off 49 balls. He also struck five fours. Raza nails down the chase Raza, who supported Bennett in the 74-run second wicket stand, continued with the big hits after the opener's departure. He struck Saifuddin for two fours in the 16th over. It left Zimbabwe with 32 needed off the last four overs. He reached his fifty off 41 balls, reaching the mark with a four off a pull. Raza then deposited Saifuddin for a huge six over midwicket, following it with a six over long-off, and a four. He finished on an unbeaten 72 off 46 balls with four sixes and six fours. Campbell was unbeaten on eight runs, hitting the winning runs in the 19th over. "

                     NAAZ impresses by Olympics representation 
                    ","National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (NAAZ) president Tendayi Tagara is impressed by the number of athletes that have so far qualified for upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics scheduled for July 26 to August 11. Marathon runners  Isaac Mpofu and Rutendo Nyahora as well as sprinters Tapiwa Makarawu and Makanakaishe Charamba have so far  booked their slots for the global meet.  Charamba is the latest addition to the list, after qualifying for the 200m event in a time of 20.00s. He joins Makarawu who had already qualified for the same event in a time of 19.87s.  Mpofu was the first to  qualify  for the Olympics in December 2022 at the Valencia  Marathon, crossing the finishing line in a time of 2 hours  6 minutes 48 seconds whilst Nyahora earned her spot through  a universality wild card. Tagara noted that the positive move comparing with the previous edition where triple jumper Chengetayi Mapaya was the only one who met the qualifying standards for the Olympics from athletics. Considering that the fact that the door is still open for other athletes leaves a possibility of increasing the number. ""We are very happy that we have been one of the two associations out of 33 Olympic sport codes that have athletes who have qualified and met the standards of the Olympics. If one looks at what we had in the last edition, we had only one athlete who met the qualifying standards, Chengetayi Mapaya, but unfortunately he could not travel,"" said Tagara. ""We had targeted to have at least two or three marathon runners and also track athletes but now that we have both, we have fulfilled our mandate and hope to have more. There is quite a number of athletes that are close to qualifying who are based abroad. This gives us hope that we are doing well and if you look at Tapiwa Makarawu for example, his times are very impressive and if he mantains that standard, he can be in the semis or finals at the Olympics."" Tagara added that the  athletes are already preparing for the Paris Games. Mpofu has been in camp since January and  took a break after the Boston marathon last month before resuming  his camp on Monday under the guidance of his coach Benson Chauke. South Africa based, Nyahora, who is the only female that has qualified so far, will be working with her coach in South Africa and Tagara said that they will see if she can join Mpofu in the final weeks so that they can work and travel together. In order to help other athletes qualify, Tagara said they will send some athletes for the upcoming  Africa Senior Championships that will be held in Cameroon in June. "

                    ","Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) has agreed a long-term lease with the City of Gweru for the development of a new cricket stadium ahead of two major global events in the country.    The agreement, which relates to a 10 446-hectare piece of land in the Midlands capital, will be legally binding for 99 years.    ZC is looking to turn the plot into a multi-purpose stadium, including spectator stands, a VIP pavilion, a media centre, corporate boxes and an accommodation facility.    “This is a 99-year lease where Zimbabwe Cricket is going to come in to construct a state-of-the art cricket ground and us, as the City of Gweru, we are providing the space in terms of the land – it’s a 10-hectare (piece of) land so that at least they can put up all the facilities . . .” Gweru Town Clerk Livingston Churu said, explaining what the agreement entails.    “It’s actually a multi-discipline facility where you are going to have cricket, you are also going to have squash, I am sure, and all the other disciplines, even tennis. So that is how it’s structured.”    After signing off the agreement on behalf of the national cricket body on Friday, an elated ZC Managing Director Givemore Makoni said: “We are pretty excited we have put pen to paper on the lease agreement between Zimbabwe Cricket and the Gweru City Council.     “This is a huge milestone as far as cricket development is concerned, as it means we are bringing cricket to the Midlands province.   “One of our strategic objectives is to become the number one sport in the country and to achieve that we are taking the game to all four corners of the country.    “But without Gweru, the capital city of one of the major provinces, that strategic goal or milestone will not be reached.”   City of Gweru Mayor Martin Chivhoko welcomed the development, hailing it as a game changer for the Midlands capital.    “As a city we are happy with this partnership that we have entered with ZC for the growth of sport in our city,” the mayor said.   “It’s also going to improve our GDP as we are going to have visitors who will come for cricket matches in our city.”     The project has come at a time Zimbabwe is preparing to co-host two major global cricket tournaments, the ICC Under-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup 2026 and the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2027.    “As you know we are hosting the Under-19 Men’s World Cup in 2026 and the Men’s World Cup in 2027 and we will need  practice and match venues . . . Gweru will be used as one of the practice venues for the main events, especially in 2027,” Makoni said.    “Whenever you host major events it’s got a huge economic impact on a country and cities.   “Bringing countries or teams to Gweru will have a huge economic impact. The spinoff will be huge in terms of accommodation, tourism in the city, the number of players and cultural exchange and all that will be coming to Gweru . . .”   "

Both teams enter the match with momentum, having secured wins in their previous games. Agama FC recently handed Banket United their first defeat of the season, while Trojan FC celebrated a victory over CC Mhangura.Emson Chitsungo, chairperson of Agama Football Club, expressed confidence in his team's prospects for the upcoming match. “With the unwavering support from our club patrons, Malvern Moyo and Anne Antonio, there are no reasons why Agama will fail to secure three points from Trojan Football Club,” he declared. Echoing Chitsungo's sentiments, Agama’s vice chairperson, Willard Garanewako, highlighted the management’s efforts to boost player morale ahead of the crucial derby. “As part of the club's management, we are doing everything we can to motivate our players, ensuring they remain focused and spirited for this Mashonaland Central Derby,” said Garanewako. Garanewako further elaborated on the ethos of the club, encapsulated in its abbreviated name, AGAMA, which stands for Athletic, Gallant, Aspiring, Motivated, and Achievers.“So, 'AGAMA Football Club' could stand for 'Athletic Gallant Aspiring Motivated Achievers Football Club,' reflecting a team of determined and spirited individuals striving for excellence in their athletic pursuits,” he explained. He said this philosophy is a testament to the club’s ambition and the high standards they set for themselves on and off the pitch.The stakes are particularly high, as Agama currently sits two points and two places above Trojan in the league standings, occupying the eighth position with nine points, while Trojan is tenth with seven points. This derby is not just a battle for points but also for local bragging rights, setting the stage for an intense and thrilling encounter. As the teams prepare to face off, the entire Province watches with bated breath, anticipating a match that promises not only to showcase the spirit and skill of its players but also to ignite the passion of football fans across Mashonaland Central.     "

                    ","SOUTH African golfer Martin Vorster stole the limelight on the second day of the FBC Zim Open after he shot a superb 10 — under par 62 to break a 30-year-old course record at Royal Harare and grab the lead going into the weekend. Voster, who managed 70 on the first day, made two eagles on the front nine and seven birdies to complete a record breaking round. A bogey on the 15th hole was the only blemish on an otherwise majestic performance by the South African golfer The 22-year-old golfer is now on 12 — under par after two rounds and is one stroke ahead of 2001 champion Darren Fichardt who carded 66 in the second round to finish the day on 11 — under par. Fichardt is tied for second place with Michael Hollick who managed 66 in the second, having shot a round of 67 on the first day. It was a fine afternoon for South African golfers who occupy the top five places on the leaderboard with Anthony Michael fourth on overall 10 — under par, while first round leader Jaco Ahlers is two shots behind on 8 — under par after a round of 71. Kieran Vincent was the country’s best placed golfer tied for 6th place with South Africans JC Ritchie and Combrinck Smit on overall 6 — under after a much improved performance of 5 — under par 67 yesterday. The 26-year-old golfer was happy with his performance. “Obviously a score is a score, but I felt my game was a lot similar to what happened yesterday. It was just that a couple of putts were holding, but all in all I have been hitting really well and I was happy to see a couple of putts going in. Obviously a 67 score is great anywhere you are,” he said. “Everything is going according to plan. We know there are low rounds out there with a 62 that was shot today, but we can just go out there and try tomorrow. You never know what can happen with 36 holes to go,” Kieran Vincent added.  It was also a good outing for local favourite Robson Chinhoi who managed a round of 68 in the second to go into the weekend on 4 – under and tied for 11th place on the leaderboard. Scott Vincent also struggled with his game on the second day after he made 1 — over par for an overall 4 — under par and tied for 11th place after two rounds. A total of nine Zimbabwean golfers will play into the weekend after making the cut.

                     Goal drought threatens DeMbare's chase
                    ","DYNAMOS have encountered real problems at this early stage of the season, and finishing is definitely one of them. In a campaign characterised by an array of things gone wrong, injuries to key players including skipper Frank Makarati and Tanaka Shandirwa, referee calls not going their way in some instances and a cat and mouse relationship between the club bosses and coach Genesis Mangombe: Little wonder it has been a slow start to their new campaign. The league title chasing side has scored just eight goals in their opening 10 games of the season, only better than six other competitors in the league. Three of the teams with fewer goals than Dynamos are Hwange, Chegutu Pirates and Arenel Movers, sides that currently occupy the bottom three places on the log table. The Harare giants' leading goal scorer is Emmanuel Paga who has netted three goals. Ahead of their match against Herentals at Rufaro Stadium tomorrow, Mangombe said he is worried about his players' inability to convert into goals the numerous chances they create. He cited last week’s match against Chicken Inn as a good example, when they completely dominated the game and created a handful of chances which they wasted, resulting in a nil-all draw. It was the same story when they faced Simba Bhora three weeks ago in a game they also completely dominated and created the better chances. They paid dearly for their inefficiency when Walter Musona netted a smash and grab winner. ""I'm happy with the way we are creating chances, but not happy with our finishing,"" Mangombe said. ""Against Chicken Inn, we dominated and created plenty of chances. Putting the ball into the back of the net still remains a problem. This week, we have been training on our finishing, and hopefully, we will see an improvement against Herentals."" The former Yadah coach is worried about the potential threat posed by bogey side Herentals. Previous clashes between the two city rivals have been fought tightly, and Mangombe believes it will be no different this time around. ""When we play against Herentals, they give it their all, always. They treat this as a proper derby, they always want to win this match. It's not just Herentals alone, every player is motivated when they face Dynamos. At the same time they want to prove that they are good players. We are prepared for that. We need to be mentally sharp because we know they (Herentals) will do everything in order to beat us,"" Mangombe said. Dynamos welcome back into the team vice captain Emmanuel Jalai who missed the trip to Bulawayo due to suspension. The bad news is that Frank Makarati and Tanaka Shandirwa, who also missed last week's game due to injuries, are yet to recover. Winger Issa Sadiki has been added on to the injury list. Mangombe is desperate to win against Herentals for two significant reasons. First, to keep pace with the leading teams, and secondly, cement his position as the head of the technical team. Mangombe's performance is reviewed after every five games, thus the Herentals game is a start of a new cycle of the matches. DeMbare currently lie in 12th position on the log standings with 11 points, eight behind log leaders Highlanders. Mangombe's could however, be awarded three points from their abandoned match against Chegutu Pirates. Herentals have also had a horrible start too, and last week's 1-0 win over Yadah was only their second victory in nine matches. Crucially, the victory moved them out of the relegation zone into 14th position with 10 points. Matchday 11 fixtures  Today: GreenFuel v Zpc Kariba (GreenFuel), Yadah v Caps United (Rufaro), Bulawayo Chiefs v Chicken Inn (Luveve), Simba Bhora v Ngezi Platinum Stars (Wadzanai).

The Bulawayo giants fired blanks last week when they drew to Arenel Movers in a match that ended goalless. But they remained on top of the log with 19 points from 10 games. They are tied with Manica Diamonds, whose goal difference is inferior. Meanwhile, FC Platinum beat Green Fuel in their last match, ending a rather nightmarish spell in April. They are now third on the standings after being awarded maximum points from the abandoned match against Caps United. A win could see FC Platinum taking pole position depending on how Manica Diamonds fare against Bikita Minerals on the same day. Mapeza is optimistic ahead of the match and has chosen not to pay attention to how Highlanders have performed since the return of Zambian coach Kelvin Kaindu. ""We still have the same players who were out against Green Fuel sidelined. They have not yet recovered so they are out. But everyone else is fine,” said Mapeza ""Highlanders have a very good coach. They have been doing very well of late. They haven't won their last games, which were derbies. ""It's a normal phase in football. Everyone goes through it in football. They are a quality team and we know the danger especially when playing at Barbourfields. ""What is important for us is to make sure that we get everything right in all the phases of the game.

                     Mohadi shamed by stadia ban
                    ","VICE-PRESIDENT Kembo Mohadi has admitted that government is embarrassed by the country's failure to host international football matches due to the country’s sub-standard facilities. Mohadi came face to face to with the level of decay of the local sporting facilities when he toured the National Sports Stadium, Magamba Hockey Stadium and Rufaro Stadium yesterday. He was accompanied by acting Sports minister Jenfan Muswere and deputy Emily Jesaya on a mission to assess progress on the rehabilitation of some of the facilities. Speaking after the tour, Mohadi said he felt ashamed and that the government is equally embarrassed by how sporting facilities have deteriorated to the extent that all stadiums have been condemned to host international matches. “Zimbabwe as one of the most elite nations, to be disqualified [from hosting international matches] and find that other countries that are least elite qualify, is an egg on our face,” Mohadi said. “I remember at one time these sporting facilities were so good that we even managed to host the All-Africa Games in 1995.” In that year, the government managed to renovate Rufaro Stadium, as well as building Magamba Hockey Stadium, Khumalo Hockey Stadium and the Aquatic Complex in Chitungwiza. Only the Khumalo Hockey stadium in Bulawayo is still fit for purpose. “Together with the councils and the central government we need to see to it that we spruce up our sporting facilities to a standard whereby we qualify to host Caf and Fifa tournaments. Sport is not just a recreational thing, it's a discipline and a career. There are many people [who] you know [who] have taken sport as a career and have done very well in their lives. We need to have state-of-the-art sporting facilities in this country because we can actually do so. I'm saying so because in 1995 when we won the bid to host the All Africa Games, sporting facilities were done within a very short space of time. It is sort of embarrassing to learn that we are being disqualified because we don't have plastic bucket seats, something that doesn't cost quite a lot. We have to end this embarrassment,” Mohadi said. Zimbabwe has not had a Caf-certified stadium since 2019 when the National Sports Stadium was condemned for failing to meet international standards. At the time, Caf said a number of areas of the stadium need to be looked into, including the installation of bucket seats, modern electronic turnstiles and automated systems, and the setting up of a functional venue operations centre with a good view of the stadium, equipped with CCTV monitors for security purposes. Caf also demanded the refurbishment of changing rooms and the upgrading of the B Arena in line with Caf training field infrastructure requirements. But five years on, very little has been done by the government to renovate the stadium to meet the required standards. In fact, the stadium has deteriorated further and is now closed for use by local clubs. Consequently, Zimbabwe are playing their international home matches in foreign lands. The country used Huye Stadium in Rwanda to host Nigeria in their 2026 World Cup qualifier in November. Next month, the Warriors will host Lesotho in the same qualifiers at Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg on June 7. This is despite assurances by Sports Minister Kirsty Coventry early this year that renovation works at the National Sports Stadium will be fast-tracked for it to be ready for the June qualifier. Mohadi said he has taken it upon himself to push for the facilities to be resuscitated. “We have taken it upon ourselves that we need to correct that. I want to thank the City of Harare through His Worship the Mayor Councillor Jacob Mafume for the strides that they have taken to spruce and mordenise Rufaro Stadium. They have managed to meet some of the requirements that are required of by Caf and Fifa. He was informing me that Rufaro is now hosting league matches, which is good music to my ears. Together, the council and the central government have got to do it. We have to create sporting facilities that meet the international standards. It will be good for us and maybe happy moments for us when we would eventually host international tournaments on our soil. “It's not much that needs to be done, the scope of works that have been availed to me for both the National Sports Stadium and Rufaro are not insurmountable,” Mohadi added. During the tour, Mohadi was informed by Sports ministry officials that work to renovate the National Sports Stadium could start in October when the bucket seats, imported from China, are expected to arrive in the country. The officials said the turnstiles and CCTV monitors are already in the country.   "

                    ","ZIMBABWE T20I captain, Sikandar Raza, who is currently going through a lean spell in the ongoing series against Bangladesh, has admitted that he and other senior batsmen have let the team down. Raza, who for long has literally been carrying the team on his shoulders is yet to make an impression in the series having so far recorded scores of zero, three and one in the three matches the Chevrons have played and lost. Bangladesh have raced to a 3-0 lead and bagging the series in the process with two games to spare. The closest the Chevrons came to winning a match was in the third T20I when they went down by nine runs. Hosts Bangladesh scored 165/5 after being put to bat first, while the visitors  perished on 156/9 at the end of their 20 overs. Raza, the mercurial Chevrons skipper who made it into the ICC Men's global T20I squad for 2023, reflected on his performance so far in the series and the bearing it has had on the team's performance. “We did fight well, but the fact is that the top five including myself haven't done well. We needed to support (Tadiwanashe) Marumani and we could have chased it down,” Raza said. “A lot of runs have come from the lower order, they've been working hard, but the results need to come.” Runs for Zimbabwe in this series have been coming from such young players as Clive Madande, Wellington Masakadza, Jonathan Campbell, Brian Bennett and Faraz Akram. This is a cause for concern for Raza and interim coach Stuart Matsikenyeri given that had at least two of the senior players chipped in at any given stage results could have been different. “We have several youngsters whom we're grooming, it's not easy for them to come to Bangladesh and do well,” noted Raza. “Mistakes have happened, but I'm okay with them. Those three youngsters put up their hands (Akram, Campbell and Marumani), and they brought us close and I thought we might win at one point. They've been a lot of positives and I'm really happy for them, but it's the top order which needs to deliver for us.” The top order has also been on top of coach Matsikenyeri’s list of worries and Raza would not have said it any better as the leader of the pack. “A little bit better, but largely still disappointing because we haven't played to the standard that we expect ourselves to. We still know that if we reach anywhere close to our standard, performance wise, that way we will be competitive and will give ourselves an opportunity to win the game,” Matsikenyeri said. “All the shortcomings, the midfields, dropped catches, loose deliveries all need cleaning up. But, it is mainly obviously the top order batting or maybe call it the core of the batting that we need to make more meaningful contributions so that we put ourselves in positions of winning games.” Zimbabwe are in Mirpur this morning for the fourth T20I against the hosts.   "

                    ","HIGHLANDERS coach Kelvin Kaindu is worried about his strikers’ struggles in front of goal ahead of the log leaders clash with FC Platinum in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match on Sunday. The Bulawayo giants fired blanks last Sunday when they were held to a goalless draw by new boys Arenel Movers in a match the Zambian gaffer believes Highlanders should have won. Bosso forwards have been lethargic of late with the league’s leading goal scorer Lynoth Chikuhwa (on five goals) having last scored when Highlanders fell 2-1 to Chicken Inn at Barbourfields (BF) three weeks ago. He struggled in the 2-0 victory over Caps United in which defender Andrew Mbeba and midfielder Mckinnon Mushore scored. Brighton Ncube’s last goal was in the 2-2 draw to Herentals in Harare two weeks ago with the other goal coming from youthful defender Mvelo Khoza. Chikuhwa and Ncube (on four goals) started the season with a bang, but their form has slumped. Kaindu is aware of the threat that FC Platinum poses, but said they were working on their finishing ahead of the Sunday clash. “Most teams have tried to prevent us from scoring and we are happy that in the last games that we have played, it is only one (against Arenel) that we have not managed to get any goal. We are still working on our finishing in offensiveness when we have the ball. We are playing FC Platinum, a formidable side and they have a good coach who can influence the result of the game at any given time. We know the pedigree that FC Platinum have, the style of play that they want to display and we hope that it is going to be entertaining to all our fans,” Kaindu said. Young attacking midfielder Prince Ndlovu is believed to be injured, while midfielder Melikhaya Ncube is suspended as he sits on three yellow cards. Kaindu spoke of an injured player due for a late fitness test, but withheld his name. “Our preparations for the coming fixture on Sunday against FC Platinum are, so far so good. The only problem that we have is a player who will be missing out because of suspension and maybe one player who still has to be attended to in terms of being fit to play. He is yet to see the doctor, but I cannot disclose his name for now,” Kaindu said. He added: “Melikhaya has been instrumental in all the games that he played. He has been consistent and he has played all the games without being substituted.” "

                     All eyes on local golfers
                    ","THERE is a palpable weight of expectation on the local golfers to provide the first winner of Zimbabwe Open when the competition tees off at Royal Harare Golf Club in Harare this morning. The FBC Zimbabwe Open championship, which has attracted 144 golfers from across the globe, is set to conclude on Sunday. All of the country’s top golfers, including the Vincent siblings Scott and Kieran, Robson Chinhoi, Ben Follett-Smith and Stuart Krog, among others are taking part in the flagship annual golf competition. There are also no less than seven former champions competing in the FBC Holding Group-sponsored event, among them defending champion Neil Schietekat, two time winner Jbe’ Kruger and 2001 winner Darren Fichardt among others. Krog, who has been playing on the Sunshine Tour for the past year believes Zimbabwe has the best chance of providing a winner of the tournament for the first time since 2000 when legend Mark McNulty bagged it at the same venue. “I think this is the best chance that we have had (to win it), but golf is golf, expectation may lead to disappointment. But I think all the Zimbabwe golfers are very comfortable in their skin and they want to put on a show and so hopefully we can keep the trophy at home,” he told NewsDay Sport yesterday. “I am ready. It’s just another week, this is a home Open, so you want to do well at home, but at the end of the day if I do everything good with my preparation then I get my best shot of succeeding during the week. I feel like I am in a good spot right now and I am excited to play this week,” the 28-year-old golfer said. The event launched on Sunday with a pre-qualifier event saw ProAm competition being held in the past two days as a precursor to the main Championship. Tournament director Michael Mahachi is happy with preparations for the Championship tee off. “I must say we are ready to get going tomorrow when the championship tees off early in the morning. All the players who entered the tournament have registered which means we don’t have any withdrawals of players we expected to make the strong field that we have this year,” he said. “A total of 144 players will tee off tomorrow and there will be a cut after 36 holes that will be 60 professional players and those tied will the proceed to the third and fourth round. “This event continues to grow not just the way we see it, but from the feedback that we get from our sponsors and partners as well the players. We have seen it has become one of the favourites on the Sunshine Tour. “This is evidenced by what the players have said during surveys that have been conducted by the Sunshine Tour. They feel it’s one of the most special events they play every year. They talk about the organisation of the event and the great golf course and above all the hospitality that they get from the Zimbabweans, so we are very proud of ourselves.” Scott Vincent will be making a second appearance at the event since his debut as a professional in 2016 when he was the best placed Zimbabwean following an impressive final round 7-under-65 which saw him tie for fourth place. Last year, the younger of the two siblings, Kieran Vincent took part in the FBC Zimbabwe Open and tied for sixth place on 3-under par 285 after four rounds of golf. Zimbabwe golf legend Nick Price, Tony Johnstone and Mark McNulty are the only local professionals to have won the tournament. Other local-based players who have done well so far are David Amm who won the Lowveld ProAm at the beginning of March before Visitor Mapwanya held his nerve to beat Brian Gondo in the National Aids Council HIV and Cancer Prevention Drive ProAm at Royal Harare two weeks later.

                    ","THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) has descended heavily on Caps United after handing the Harare giants a hefty fine for causing the abandonment of their league match against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium earlier this season. The PSL disciplinary committee slapped a US$5 000 fine on the Green Machine for their fans' hooliganism, while club coach Lloyd Chitembwe was also fined US$400 for his post-match outburst in which he branded the match officials “stupid”. FC Platinum, who were leading the match 1-0 when the match was called off due to crowd trouble, have been handed the game on a 3-0 forfeiture scoreline. Consequently, the Zvishavane side moves into third position on the log standings with 18 points, one behind joint leaders Highlanders and Manica Diamonds after 10 rounds of matches, while Caps United remain on seventh position with 13 points, although their goal difference section on the log table has taken a significant knock. In a statement yesterday, the PSL said Caps United had been found guilty of causing the abandonment of the match and will pay US$4 500 plus the costs of the hearing. ""The club was found guilty of causing the abandonment of the match and fined a sum of US$5 000, US$500 of which is suspended on condition that the club is not convicted of a similar offense. The effective fine of US$4 500 together with the costs of the hearing is to be paid by May 27, 2024. Additionally, the match has been forfeited and awarded to FC Platinum on a 3-nil scoreline. Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe was also found guilty of making statements that bring the league into disrepute and dined US$400."" The match was abandoned around 85th minutes after the away fans invaded the pitch in protest over a Ralph Kawondera disallowed goal. The home side had taken a first half lead through Juan Mutudza before the former FC Platinum midfielder thought he had secured a point for a his side late on, but his effort was disallowed by match officials for an offside, much to the disgust of the Caps United fans who decided to take matters into their hands. The PSL disciplinary committee is also expected to make a judgement in another abandoned match between Dynamos and Chegutu Pirates at Baobab Stadium last month. The match was called off after Chegutu Pirates supporters protested the awarding of a late Dynamos goal by Emmanuel Paga which they argued did not cross the goal line. Both teams were asked by the league bosses to submit reports of what transpired on the ill-fated day. "

The Chevrons are trailing 3-0 to their hosts in the T20I series ahead of the fourth and final matches tomorrow and Sunday, respectively. Zimbabwe came agonisingly close to win the third match on Tuesday after an improved performance, but fell short to give Bangladesh an unassailable 3-nil lead. Matsikenyeri admitted his charges have not been up to the required standards in this tour, and has challenged his players to salvage their pride and ranking points from the remaining two matches. Zimbabwe are currently ranked number 13 in T20I rankings behind Ireland and Scotland who are number 11 and 12, respectively, while Afghanistan sits on 10th position. India is on number one, followed by Australia and England. ""Ranking points are important, so whichever way selection for the next matches goes, we have to keep pushing for some wins before we leave here,"" Matsikenyeri told NewsDay Sport. The Chevrons, buoyed by some impressive bowling display from pace bowler Blessing Muzarabani, came close to revive the series on Tuesday in the third T20I match. The towering seamer picked three wickets for 14 from four overs. This was after Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza elected to bowl first, with the hosts reaching 165/5 in their allotted overs. Raza and Faraz Akram picked a wicket apiece before the latter’s late onslaught with the bat, a 19-ball 34. Opener Tadiwanashe Marumani’s 31 off 26 and Jonathan Campbell’s 10-ball 21 saw the visitors fall by just nine runs. Zimbabwe ran out of balls at 156/9. “I thought we had a good chance at half way. The target was definitely not out of reach. Unfortunately, we just didn’t find momentum in the middle period of our batting, losing our experienced batters early didn’t help,” Matsikenyeri said. “But it was pleasing to see that we still put our best foot forward and did our best to chase it down with our lower order who struck the ball pretty well. Massive positive with the ball from Muzarabani, thought he bowled really well, with good aggression and control. Raza, who is struggling for form with the bat in Bangladesh, conceded he needed to up his tempo. “We did fight well, but the fact is that the top five including myself haven’t done well. We needed to support Marumani and we could have chased it down. A lot of runs have come from the lower order, they have been working hard, but the results need to come,” said Raza after the match. “We have several youngsters whom we are grooming, it’s not easy for them to come to Bangladesh and do well. Mistakes have happened, but I’m okay with them. Those three youngsters put up their hands (Akram, Campbell and Marumani), and they brought us close and I thought we might at one point in time. There have been a lot of positives and I’m really happy for them, but it’s the top order which needs to deliver for us.” "

                    ","TOP Zimbabwean golfer Robson Chinhoi is confident of causing an upset and win the FBC Zimbabwe Open championship which tees off at Royal Harare Golf Club tomorrow morning. Chinhoi, who has been doing well on the Sunshine Tour in the past 12 months is one of the country's high profile golfers who will be flying the country’s flag at the Zim Open. Others include the Vincent siblings Scott and Kieran as well Ben Follett-Smith and Stuart Krog who are playing golf outside the country. The Zimbabwe Open has been dominated by South Africans who have won all the editions since the reintroduction of the event in 2010. The golfer who turns 33 today arrived in the country on Monday evening after competing at the Waterfall City TC by Attacq where he finished in a two-way tie 26th last weekend.  “It is always good to be home. The target for this year is I think everyone is always thinking about winning. Nobody is playing to just make the cut, so we are playing to win. I am just looking to play well and be myself and see what happens,” he said soon after his arrival. Chinhoi bagged the biggest win of his career in May last year when he won the Sunshine Tour-sanctioned Zanaco Masters in Zambia. At least 33 golfers out of the 144 taking part in Zimbabwe’s premier golf event will compete under the Zimbabwe flag among them top junior players such as Braydon Amm (16), Keegan Shutt (17) and Tanaka Chatora (18). The official opening of the 2024 FBC Zimbabwe Open was held at Royal Harare where club captain Tendayi Gwatiringa handed the 126-year-old golf facility to the Zimbabwe Open Committee. Zimbabwe Open Committee chairperson Livingston Gwata received the club flag from Gwatiringa. Gwata expressed gratitude to the sponsors who have made the staging of the country's flagship event possible. “We want to express our special gratitude to the title sponsors FBC Holdings Limited for the third year in succession. Thank You Trynos Kufazvineyi and your team for making this happen. We have an array of other sponsors who continue to be with us. “It does promise to be an exciting tournament. It is difficult times in terms of the economy and for our sponsors to come out in full force and do what they have done we, as the Zim Open Committee, are most grateful,” he said. The 2024 edition of the Zim Open will see at least seven former winners, including defending champion Neil Schietekat, two-time champion Jbe' Kruger, Albert Venter, JC Ritchie, Lyle Rowe, Jean Hugo and Darren Fichardt taking part.

                    ","NGEZI Platinum Stars' nervy 1-0 victory over Bulawayo Chiefs on Saturday ended a five match winless streak for the defending champions and coach Takesure Chiragwi hopes it will be the catalyst to turn around their league fortunes. Madamburo, who had lost once and drew four in their previous five matches, got back on track with a Takunda Benhura first half goal. The win helped ease some pressure on Chiragwi who is under the microscope after his team's underwhelming start to the season. “I hope with this win, the heavens have smiled on us to go on a good winning run,” a relieved Chiragwi said. “I believe this could be the start of a winning phase for us. I can feel it because we are coming from a tough phase. I am just hoping that the difficult phase is behind us and we can start winning games again. We should start to enjoy the phase of winning, which is important for the team.” The club’s management have publicly backed Chiragwi and he is appreciative. “It is very important for me. As the head coach of the team, I am happy to know that my bosses are always there for me. They understand that we are going through a bad phase. They also know that being defending champions is not easy because every team wants to beat us. I really appreciate their support and I am happy because they always give us an umbrella that protect us from any storm. They have been very supportive in everything. This is a great club, to be honest, and we are happy with our management because when the situation is like this, it is also difficult for them but they understand what we are going through.” Ngezi Platinum’s major problem this season has been their porous defence which has let in nine goals so far against the eight that they have scored. They have managed to keep five clean sheets in their first 10 games of the season. Chiragwi is demanding his defence, which was the team’s pillar of strength last season, to pull up their socks. “If you score goals and then you do not defend well, you do not win matches. The basic football language is to make sure that you concentrate the whole 90 minutes. If you score, defend well, you win. But if you open up at the back and concede easily, then you are likely to lose or draw. We are working on it ... that once we get goals, we do not have to concede nomatter how difficult the situation might be. We have to show resistance at the back,” he added. "

                     Matsikenyeri demands better from batters
                    ","ZIMBABWE senior men's cricket team interim coach Stuart Matsikenyeri has demanded an improved performance from the top order batsmen if the team is to stay alive in the ongoing T20I series against hosts Bangladesh. The Chevrons found themselves two matches down following eight-wicket and six-wicket loses in their first and second T20 Internationals. In both matches the Achilles hill has been the top order batting that has not been able to put enough runs on the board with the senior players struggling the most. Clive Madande and Wellington Masakadza fought hard with the bat in the series opener, scoring 43 and 34 runs, respectively, to give their bowlers some decent score to defend after the top crumbled early, leaving the visitors on 36/4 in the power play. This was after Joylord Gumbie scored 17, Craig Ervine nought, Brian Bennett 16, with veterans Sean Williams and Craig Ervine both failing to get off the mark. The second match saw youngsters Jonathan Campbell and Brian Bennett taking the fight to their hosts with unbeaten on debut on 45 and 44, respectively, as the team laboured to 138/7 in 20 overs. In the Sunday match, Ervine managed 13 after Tadiwanashe Marumani fell for two runs with Gumbie chewing 30 balls for his 17. Sikandar Raza only managed three, while Clive Madande fell for a duck. After the poor show by the established batters, Matsikenyeri wants to see a better display. “It was a little bit better (on Sunday) but largely still disappointing because we have not played to the standard that we expect ourselves. We still know that if we reach anywhere close to our standard, performance wise, that way we will be competitive and will give ourselves an opportunity to win the game,” Matsikenyeri told NewsDay Sport. “All the shortcomings, the midfields, dropped catches, loose deliveries all need cleaning up. But, it is obviously the top order batting or maybe call it the core of the batting that we need to make more meaningful contributions so that we can stay alive in the series."" The former Zimbabwe batsman was impressed by Campbell and Bennett’s batting tipping them to go far with consistent performances. “If anything, that has been the positive of the tour so far. We have had some of our not so experienced and younger players coming out and putting their best foot forward finding answers and playing positively. Brian and Jonathan were those two for us yesterday (Sunday) they were very good in their approach, they were very positive. They conducted themselves exactly the way we trained when we were preparing for this trip,” he added. “So, it was good to see and you know as long as they keep working and they stay as confident they will play well for Zimbabwe in the future like they did yesterday (Sunday).” Bowling all-rounder Masakadza is recuperating well and might be in line for selection for the third T20I  today. “So far Wellington has done okay. He took that knock on the head in the first game, but he sat out yesterday (Sunday), we did everything that was asked of him to help him with getting better. He has been looking good so, obviously we are taking it by the hour,” said Matsikenyeri. “We see how he is in the morning and then we make a call from there. But, so far the medical team is happy that he is coming through okay, hopefully he continues to improve.” Zimbabwe will play two more T20I matches against Bangladesh after today. "

The stalemate meant that the Bulawayo giants now have the same number of points as Manica Diamonds who defeated ZPC Kariba at Nyamhunga on Saturday. Highlanders coach Kelvin Kaindu said the draw felt like a defeat. “It’s not even a point gained. I would say we dropped three points today. Out of all the games that we have drawn, I feel this is a game that we should have won. In terms of playing our local teams, we have drawn twice and lost once and I think there is a lot of complacency in our team. We have also noticed that every team that we draw with is celebrating. If you don’t score early against these teams you get frustrated. They will be going down and delaying like what that keeper was doing,” Kaindu said. Arenel coach Farai Tawachera was happy with a draw which they dedicated to their vice-chairman Bheka “Mahii” Sibanda, who collapsed and died in a Bulawayo shop on Saturday morning. “I am happy with the point. It’s not easy to play Highlanders. One needs to bring a lot of thinking into the game. We just said let them play and we play. But when we get the ball, let’s hit them where it matters most. We could have buried them in the first half. We were a bit hesitant in the final third. But it’s normal, we are a new team trying to work our combinations. It takes time,” Tawachera said. Arenel showed early in the game that they were not intent on just sitting to protect a point with forays of their own. Highlanders’ shot-stopper Raphael Pitisi cut out a potentially dangerous cross by Arenel’s Kudzaishe Dzingwe in the 12th minute. A blunder by left-back Archford Faira and central defender Peter Muduhwa inside their penalty area almost cost Highlanders in the 17th minute, but Pitisi once again came to the rescue from another Dzingwe effort. Brighton Ncube, for Highlanders, connected an Andrew Mbeba freekick in the 38th minute, but Arenel goalkeeper Aaron Ngwenya made a brilliant save. Content with a draw, Arenel started employing time-wasting antics going into the second half with no meaningful attack from either side. Ngwenya, the culprit in time-wasting was cautioned by referee Owen Manenda and Tawachera had no kind words for the goalkeeper after the match. Highlanders skipper Muduhwa tried to lead by example, advanced upfront and caused anxious moments for Arenel Movers in the second half, but the goals would not come.

Quick fire goals early in the contest, first from Manondo, who connected a Junior Bunjira cross at the back post and a Hastings Chapusha rising shot following a corner kick three minutes later, put the Green Machine on their way to a comfortable win. Manondo put the Lloyd Chitembwe-coached side out of sight with a 41st minute headed goal, connecting a perfect Eric Manokore cross from the right as the Green Machine bounced back from their loss away to Highlanders last week. Bottom placed Hwange were in shambles defensively in this one-sided contest in the first half, but still managed to cause a brief scare towards the break when Pritchard Mphelele forced a good save by Caps goalkeeper Tonderai Mateyaunga. The first half lead allowed Caps United to play with a lot of freedom in the second stanza as they passed the ball around nicely with new boy Kingsley Mureremba, given his first start since he joined from relegated Cranborne Bullets, a joy to watch. Manondo could have registered a hat trick early in the second half when he rose unmarked a few metres out, but his thumping header went straight into the hands of Hwange keeper Bhekimpilo Ncube. That proved to be the only meaningful chance in the uneventful second half. The three points moved Caps United into seventh position with 13 points, six behind log leaders Highlanders after 10 rounds of matches. The defeat was Hwange’s sixth of the season as the struggling side remained bottom of the standings with six points from a possible 30. Their coach Nation Dube, who is under pressure after the horrible start to their season, admitted things are not well. “We just failed to defend the crosses into the box and the opponent utilised their chances,” Dube said. “We go back to the drawing board and see how we can improve on our defending because we are creating chance, but also failing to convert them. We are so porous at the back. I'm worried because if we can go six games without a win, as a coach you become worried.” Chitembwe was happy with his team's response following the defeat to Highlanders last week. “It was a good game, and we are happy. We scored more and did a very good job in terms of defending. But I think we need to do more, be more consistent.” Commenting on Manondo's performance, he said: “His performance was good.

                    ","PORTUGUESE national Baltemar Brito has unfinished business with the Warriors which has prompted him to apply for the vacant Zimbabwe senior men’s national football team’s coaching job. The Zifa normalisation committee has invited applications for the job for the second time having previously appointed Brito only on interim basis for the two 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers against Nigeria and Rwanda last year. An impeccable source within the leadership of local football confirmed that the former Warriors and Highlanders’ gaffer had applied for the job. “He [Brito] applied. He wants to come back [to Zimbabwe]. I think he has more interest in Zimbabwe than the recent possibility of him joining the Cameroon national team where he was invited for interviews. He has always had his mind on Zimbabwe to finish the job that he started,” the source said. During the week, Zifa flighted a fresh advertisement for the Warriors job as the senior men’s team will be in South Africa in June to take on Lesotho and Bafana Bafana at Orlando Stadium  and Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein at home and away, respectively. Zimbabwe has no stadium  fit to host a competitive international match. In the advert, Zifa stated that the duties of the coach with a Caf Pro or Caf “A” license would be to: “Lead the senior men’s national team and direct the programme and preparations of the teams for various tournaments, including the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers and Cosafa tournaments.” It said the ideal candidate must have extensive international football knowledge and experience, particularly at the senior national team level and prior experience coaching an African national team is an added advantage. The ideal candidate must have the ability to foster a competitive and successful team and should have strong educational background with a clear coaching methodology. Familiarity with the role of sports science in preparing players for international competitions is also one of the attributes. Local coaches have also been urged to apply. After 18 months in the wilderness due to a Fifa ban following government interference, Zimbabwe returned to international football in July last year. Brito, then Highlanders’ coach, was in September appointed as Warriors’ interim coach and took charge of the Group C 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers in Rwanda in November. The Warriors played a home match against Nigeria at Huye Stadium and it ended one-all having played a goalless draw against Rwanda days earlier. They have picked up two points in Group C and Brito is looking forward to resume Warriors’ hunt for World Cup qualification. The Portuguese gaffer’s contract with Zifa ended on December 31 and back then, the national football governing body said they could not continue with Brito because they could not afford him.

                    ","BULAWAYO fans will have a football treat this weekend with two exciting Castle Lager Premier Soccer League matches lined up at Barbourfields Stadium today and tomorrow. Chicken Inn, coming from a 2-0 defeat to Yadah at Heart Stadium last weekend, return home for another tough assignment against Dynamos at BF. After the loss to Yadah, the Gamecocks (15 points) were dislodged from the second spot by on-fire Manica Diamonds (16 points) and they dropped further down to position four as Bulawayo Chiefs (15 points) rose on the log standings after beating Chegutu Pirates. Against Dynamos today, Chicken Inn are without Danny “Deco” Phiri, who saw red against The Miracle Boys and Brighton Makopa is being monitored after an injury in the last game. Coach Joey Antipas is hoping for the best against Dynamos and bouncing back to winning ways. “It is a hell of a game. We are expecting fireworks. Dynamos are a good side and like Highlanders, are one of the biggest clubs in the country. We are looking forward to the game and hopeful that we bounce back. Deco is out and Makopa will have to pass a late fitness test and we will see what happens,” Antipas said. Dynamos are also missing key players through injury or suspension. Skipper Frank Makarati, his deputy Emmanuel Jalai and Tanaka Shandirwa will miss the match. Makarati and Shandirwa are out injured while Jalai is suspended. Coach Genesis Mangombe needs an outright win against Chicken Inn to keep his job safe at the Harare giants. Tomorrow log leaders Highlanders have a tough one against city neighbours Arenel Movers. Bosso coach Kelvin Kaindu is spoilt for choice as his squad has a clean bill of health. Highlanders lead the pack with 18 points and look forward to stretching that lead. “These boys are quite familiar with each other; they interact with each other and that makes it very difficult. It’s a derby. We won last weekend but this is a different game, the other one is gone. We have done well against big teams and struggled against small teams. We struggled against Herentals and this is almost similar. We hope to make it. What we must do is guard against complacency,” Kaindu said. Highlanders are banking on Lynoth Chikuhwa, Brighton Ncube, Devine Mhindirira and the enterprising right-back Mvelo Khoza. Arenel coach Farai Tawachera said they will not give Highlanders three points on a silver platter. "

                    ","THE Warriors will “host” Lesotho in South Africa for their next 2026 World Cup home qualifier early next month after the Zifa normalisation committee settled for Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg for the crucial clash. The “hosting” of the match in South Africa comes after government once again failed on its promise to rehabilitate the National Sports Stadium to meet the required Confederation of African Football (Caf) standards. Sports minister Kirsty Coventry last year assured the nation that the facility will be renovated and be ready in time for the Warriors to play the match against the Crocodiles on June 7 at the National Sports Stadium. However, not much work has been done to spruce up the deteriorating National Sports Stadium since then, leaving the Zifa normalisation committee with no option but to look for an alternative venue outside the country. The committee yesterday announced through their official social media channels that the Warriors will be at “home” against Lesotho at the Orlando Stadium. Kick off is 6pm. Four days later, Zimbabwe will face off with South Africa in an away match which has been scheduled for the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. The match will start at 9pm. The Warriors played their last home match against Nigeria in Rwanda where they had also faced the hosts in their first group match of the campaign. They managed to pick two points from the two clashes which were overseen by coach Baltemar Brito who has since left the job. Zifa are currently in search of the Warriors coach after advertising for the vacant position this week. Zimbabwe are second from the bottom in Group C of the 2026 Fifa World Cup African qualifiers which also has Benin. The National Sports Stadium was condemned in 2019 to host international matches. At the time, Caf said a number of areas of the stadium needed to be looked at for it to meet international standards. These included the installation of bucket seats made of unbreakable and non-inflammable material, modern electronic turnstiles and automated systems and the setting up of a functional venue operations centre with a good overview of the stadium equipped with CCTV monitors for security purposes. Caf also demanded the refurbishment of changing rooms and the upgrading of the B Arena in line with Caf training field infrastructure requirements. But three years on, very little has been done by the government to renovate the stadium to meet the Caf and Fifa standards despite Coventry’s assurances. In fact, the stadium has deteriorated further with the playing surface suffering from neglect. "

                     Bosso won’t have it easy: Arenel
                    ","ARENEL Movers coach Farai Tawachera has warned Highlanders that they face a tough fight for three points when the two sides clash in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. Tawachera said his boys are free of the pressure that suffocates big clubs when they face Bosso at BF. “It is a big game considering we are playing the big brother of the region. It is not going to be an easy game for us, neither is it going to be easy for them. We want to go there and express ourselves and exhibit what we can do. We are not under any pressure at all. There is nothing new about losing to Highlanders. We have seen big teams losing to Highlanders at BF and that makes us go out with no pressure but a free mind to express ourselves,” Tawachera said. He hoped his boys would have recovered from fatigue after travelling more than 3 000km by road to fulfil the last three matches. They are monitoring captain Zibusiso Dambo and striker Toto Banda who are recovering from injuries. Arenel lost their last two matches to Manica Diamonds and Green Fuel and sit on position 16 on the log table with eight points from one win and five draws. They have lost three matches going into the 10th game of the season. They face Highlanders who lead the championship race with 18 points from five wins, three draws and one defeat. After losing to Chicken Inn at BF and a draw to Herentals in Harare, Highlanders dispatched Caps United at home and are away to Arenel who have given big clubs a headache. Highlanders’ top striker Lynoth Chikuhwa has scored five goals to date and leads on the scorers’ charts. They will be looking up to him to provide the goals upfront. Highlanders have unearthed an enterprising right-back in teenager Mvelo Khoza, who is blessed with brilliant crosses. Khoza (18) impressed when he came in for an ineffective Brian Mlotshwa in Bosso’s loss to Chicken Inn and impressed. He has not looked back with coach Kelvin Kaindu putting his trust in the youthful defender. "

                     Lack of incentives sniffles Young Sables
                    ","THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) shot themselves in the foot due to their failure to provide incentives to the Young Sables side during the recently concluded Africa Rugby Barthes Trophy, which was won by Kenya. Hosting the continental cup brought about significant benefits and numerous advantages due to the passionate and enthusiastic support of local rugby fans. The Machinery Exchange Stadium at Harare Sports Club was packed to the rafters with fans  rallying behind their team in all three matches. Young Sables head coach Shaun de Souza, who missed out on a third straight Barthes Trophy victory, pointed out the lack of incentives as a major draw back. De Souza was aplopetic with anger. “We need to incentivise these boys. They have been working hard since November last year and this was their third attempt at the trophy, but they have nothing to show for it,” De Souza fumed. “Their parents have made sacrifices and these boys deserve recognition. Let us show some decency and give them the reward they deserve.” ZRU president Aaron Jani said the union wants to open opportunities for the players rather than pay them. “We are creating much better opportunities than the physical allowances they will get and blow in one day. So, now our focus is to put that money that would have gone to allowances and put into into preparations,” said Jani. “I am sure you have all seen that where the boys are staying, it is no less than a five-star hotel. All this is to set their mind to a professional level which is good for their future.” Everything went wrong for the Young Sables on Sunday. They gave away a 10-0 lead to lose the match 13-28, missing out on a Junior Rugby World Cup slot. Captain Benoni Nhekairo bemoaned that his troops  played to the gallery because of the colourful crowd that thronged the stadium. “I am not going to hide the fact that we gave Kenya the game. I feel like we were the better side but Kenya stuck together. They played as a family and they really put us on the back foot. They were better than us on the day,” Nhekairo said. “I think in the second half you could see players were now arguing, shouting at each other. I feel like boys were feeling the pressure and when little mistakes were made, we were going at each other’s [throat] instead of motivating each other; its part of the game. You learn as you go through.” "
