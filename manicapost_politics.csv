Post Reporter IN a shocking show of brutality, an unknown assailant allegedly mugged and fatally stabbed a Buhera nurse at her doorstep, plunging the Nerutanga community into deep mourning recently. The incident happened in Mangwanya Village under Chief Nerutenga in Buhera. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka confirmed the brutal incident, and identified the defenceless victim as Ms Ivy Mangwanya (40), a nurse who was stationed at Nerutanga Clinic in Buhera. She was allegedly accosted and murdered on her doorstep as she returned from Masvingo. The suspect allegedly stabbed her with a sharp object, and left her to bleed to death as he vanished from the scene into the darkness with US$50. Assistant Inspector Chinyoka appealed to members of the public with information leading to the arrest of the suspect to contact their nearest police station. “I can confirm a tragic incident that occurred on April 28 in Mangwanya Village under Chief Nerutenga in Buhera, when a local nurse, Ms Ivy Mangwanya who had just arrived from Masvingo, was stabbed on the throat with a sharp object by an unknown assailant. The suspect snatched a Vodacom cellphone and bag containing various clothes and vanished from the scene, leaving the victim to bleed to death,” he said. Assistant Inspector Chinyoka said Ms Mangwanya lost a lot of blood as she screamed for help. She later got late help from one Zivanai from the same village, who rushed to the scene and found her gasping for air. Ms Mangwanya died before Zivanai could rush her to hospital.   A report was made at ZRP Buhera and police attended the scene. “A bag, suspected to be the one that had been stolen from Ms Magwanya was recovered with some clothes. The deceased’s body was taken to Murambinda Mission Hospital for a post-mortem. The suspect is still at large, and we are appealing to the public with information pertaining to the whereabouts of the unknown suspect to report to any nearest police station,” said Assistant Inspector Chinyoka.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/church-clerk-up-for-12-000-fraud/,Church clerk up for $12 000 fraud,"The ManicaPost   Post Correspondent THE United Methodist Church in Rusape was prejudiced of over US$12 000 by its accounts clerk who allegedly took advantage of laxity in controls to forge receipts and manipulate amounts paid by different assemblies for five months. The church’s accounts clerk — Miriam Chibvura (44), of Silverbow, Rusape, was recently arrested and arraigned before the courts to answer theft charges as defined in Section 113 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23. She allegedly siphoned more than US$12 000 from the church’s coffers through forging receipts between March 1, 2023 and August 31, 2023. Chibvura, who is being represented by Mr Munyaradzi Manyengavana, of Manyengavana Law Chambers, was not asked to plead when she appeared before Rusape magistrate, Mr Tapiwa Kuhudzayi last week. She was remanded out of custody on her cognisant (free bail). Ms Belinda Chari prosecuted. Ms Chari said Chibvura would receive varying amounts of money from the churches under Makoni-Buhera District, and issued out correct receipts, but would later create other receipts with lesser amounts. The offence came to light when she presented two receipts books with different payments, prompting senior members of the church to institute an audit. “On an unknown date, but during the period extending March 1, 2023 to August 31, 2023, the accused person hatched a plan to steal from her employer. She received different amounts of cash from the United Methodist churches in and around Rusape and issued out receipts. The receipts issued were a confirmation of cash received from the churches. However, Chibvura converted cash amounting to US$12 333 to her own use. “The accused person destroyed the receipts books with copies she had issued to the churches. She took another unused receipt book and re-receipted the cash she had received from churches, plucking out receipts, and at the same time destroying the original receipts. The fake receipt book running from DY400 to DY600 are held as exhibit. “Chibvura later compiled two different financial statements using statistics from the doctored receipt books and submitted them for presentation at financial meetings held in September and November 2023, respectively. “She was asked to produce the receipts books, and only managed to furnish two receipt books of which one of them was fake. Of the two receipts books, one was purported to have been used to receipt United States dollars (USD), while the other one was for ZWL dollars,” said Ms Chari. Ms Chari said an alert board member of the trustee, Mr Edward Mukoyi and church members conducted an audit comparing the income, which was US$43 072 against the expenditure of US$31 639, and discovered an unaccounted variance of US$12 333. When questioned about the difference, Chibvura failed to account for it resulting in a police report being made. “The original receipts issued by Chibvura to churches were re-collected by the informant from the churches. The fake receipts will be produced in court as exhibits. The total value stolen is US$12 333 and nothing was recovered,” said Ms Chari.   "

Weekender Reporter A DEVASTATED Mutare woman has approached the court seeking an order barring her possessive ex-husband, Bornface Zvawashe from pressurising her into reconciling with him. Stung by Kunashe Mare’s incessant rejection, Zvawashe allegedly demanded a refund of the bride price he paid to her family during the subsistence of their marriage. This is seen as part of the broader strategy to pressurise Mare to reconcile with him at all costs, prompting her to approach Mutare Civil Court for a protection order. The two appeared before Mutare magistrate, Mr Xavier Chipato who granted the protection order which is valid for the next five years. “Your worship, we separated in 2011, and since then he has been a constant source of distress in my life. He has resorted to physical violence and verbal abuse to intimidate me. He always says that we should reconcile and threatens that if we do not get back together, he will demand his bride price back from my parents,” she said. Mare added that Zvawashe texts and insults her over the phone. “Recently he sent me a text message insulting me and my parents, saying my parents did not raise me well because I left my matrimonial home. That is not true. “He was unfaithful to the extent of proposing love to my sister to be his side chick. I did not say anything though I realised at that moment that he does not deserve me. As we speak, this man has two wives, but still bothers me. I am scared because I am now employed as a domestic worker, and if he comes to my workplace and cause commotion, I might lose my job,” she said. Responding to the allegations, Zvawashe was not ashamed of his aggressive behaviour. He admitted harassing Mare, saying he wanted her back as a wife. “I am not denying that I went to her place and caused havoc. I did that out of love. I love her, but she does not want to submit to my terms and conditions. She tells people our family secrets, a reason why at one point I sent her an insulting text message.   She had no right to talk about my family issues to people, it is my private life after all.   I have two wives, but I love her more than them, yet she no longer wants to warm my bed.   “I even suggested consulting her aunts, but every time I meet them we never come to an agreement. They no longer want me as their son in-law. I cannot completely turn my back on her as we have two children together. “I asked for the bride price refund because her uncles do not give me a listening ear, which really eats my heart,” he said. Mr Chipato advised the two to come to a reasonable understanding so that Zvawashe can have access to their children.   "

Senior Reporter   THREE senior police officers from the Asset Forfeiture Unit in Harare who were arrested for allegedly digging a Nyanyadzi homestead in search of an undisclosed hidden treasure were this week acquitted by the courts.   The trio — Shepherd Tachiona (50) (Detective Superintendent) of Dawnview Park, Harare; Mkhululi Nyoni (51) (Detective Chief Inspector) of Manyame Park, Chitungwiza and Monica Madzima (Detective Inspector) of Chipukutu Park, Ruwa — who are attached to the Asset and Forfeiture Unit, CID Headquarters in Harare, — were acquitted at the close of the State case on Tuesday.   The defence, comprising Messrs Musindo Hungwe and James Nemaisa of M.D Hungwe Attorneys at Law, made an application and the State, which was represented by Mr Tirivanhu Mutyasira conceded that it had failed to prove a prima facie case to warrant the accused trio to be put on their defence.   Initially, the trio spent three nights in custody following their arrest in December last year on criminal abuse of duty as a public officer charges as defined in Section 174 (1) (a) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23.   Upon their initial court appearance, they were remanded out of custody to January 1, 2024 on US$50 bail each.   It was alleged that the accused persons, in the exercise of their functions as public officers, intentionally dug the homestead yard of Ms Simangaliso Memory Mushaya in search of a treasure allegedly hidden underground without authority from their principal as well as engagement of other relevant Government experts, for the purpose of showing disfavour to the State; a conduct which is contrary to or inconsistent with their duty as public officers.   The court heard that on December 22, Tachiona, Nyoni and Madzima proceeded to Nyanyadzi Irrigation Scheme in search of a treasure allegedly hidden underground there.   “Upon arrival in Nyanyadzi, they approached the house owner, Ms Simangaliso Memory Mushaya armed with a warrant of search and seizure issued on October 18, 2023 at Chipinge Magistrates’ Court by the resident magistrate, Mr Mkwananzi (Franklyn). They informed the house owner that they intended to dig her homestead’s yard in search of the hidden treasure,” said Mr Mutyasira.   The owner of the homestead allegedly complied with the given instruction.   “In pursuit of their mission, the accused persons had not advised their principal before embarking on the mission as is the norm. Further, they had not engaged other relevant Government departments for their expert services. Instead, they had sought the services of one structural surveyor, Victor Mukungunugwa employed by Zimbabwe National Geospatial and Space Agency whom they intended to pay for his services in their personal capacity.   “They had also sought the services of a prophet, Revesai Matimba, who claims to have spiritual powers to detect precious minerals,” said Mr Mutyasira.   It is alleged that the accused persons were later intercepted by the police in the midst of digging in search of the alleged hidden treasure on Christmas Day.   "

Weekender Reporter A CHIPINGE man last Friday caused a stir as he roamed the streets of Mutare with a puff adder and crabs in a transparent plastic bag. He was later arrested and fined for criminal nuisance. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka said Learnmore Mayengamhuru, of Muruweru Village, under Chief Musikavanhu in Chipinge, was charged with criminal nuisance as defined in Section 46 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9: 23. “He was arrested after being found in possession of a dead puff adder and crabs in the central business district (CBD) of Mutare. Police details escorted him to Mutare Central Police Station where he was fined for criminal nuisance. He was released after paying a fine,” he said, adding that the dead reptile and crabs were handed over to Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority. “The snake and crabs were in their early stages of decomposition, and therefore were disposed of. Mayengamhuru, however, did not say how he got the dead creatures,” he said. The unusual find, drew a large crowd, with curious onlookers following the man, who was being accompanied by two cycling cops to Mutare Central Police Station. The superstitious among them labelled Mayenganhuru a ritualist. They argued that he wanted to use the snake for money making rituals. However, Mayengamhuru maintained his cool and never answered back as he stood guarded by the police officers. A vendor, Tambudzai Maringosi who was among the first to discover that Mayengamhuru was carrying a dead snake in a plastic bag, said they were shocked to see the man walking freely on the pavements with his “parcel”. “He was walking in the city’s downtown area when we saw that he was carrying a snake in a plastic bag. We did not know whether the snake was dead or alive, but it looked alive at that point. “Someone shouted that he was carrying a snake, and he was suddenly mobbed as people rushed to catch a glimpse of him. “Some wanted to administer instant justice on him, but luckily there were two police officers on patrol nearby, who apprehended and took him to Mutare Central Police Station,” she said. Another onlooker, Chipo Ratidzanwa said they nearly beat the man on suspicions of being a ritualist. “People wanted to beat him, but they were afraid that the snake might react and attack them. It was upon arrival at Mutare Central Police Station when it was discovered that the snake was dead. “All along people thought that it was alive. He was very lucky because the police did not take time to arrive and escort him, otherwise people wanted to beat him up believing that he was a ritualist,” she said.   "

Weekender Reporter A 19-YEAR-OLD woman dragged her ex-boyfriend, Munashe Gwinyi to court, demanding US$100 for the maintenance of their two children. Tendai Munyusa told the court that she has been solely shouldering the responsibilities of raising their two kids on her own. The case underscores the difficult circumstances facing many young women, particularly those lacking adequate support from their partners.   The two appeared before Mutare magistrate, Ms Purity Gumbo, who ordered Gwinyi to pay US$50 towards the upkeep of the two children. “Your Worship, I humbly seek your intervention in my current predicament. Despite my parents’ generous support, the financial burden of caring for my two children has become overwhelming. “ In light of my parents’ recent need to prioritise my siblings’ schooling, I have been left without assistance for some time. “I am now requesting a monthly maintenance payment of US$100 from my ex-husband, Gwinyi, who earns US$250 from his current employment. “This amount is modest and represents a fair share of his income, considering that he also has other children to support. I knew our love was never meant to be, but I never thought he will turn his back on his own children. “He has never shown any interest in their wellbeing, and it breaks my heart. From the moment I gave birth, he has been completely disengaged, oblivious to their ages and the simple joys of parenthood. “ To think that he could forsake his own flesh and blood is truly unfathomable,” she said. Gwinyi denied the assertions, arguing that he has been assisting the children whenever he could. “Your worship, I refute the claims that I have completely neglected my children. “While it may be true that I am not aware of their precise ages, that does not reflect lack of care or involvement in their lives. To the contrary, I provide assistance when I am financially able to do so. I have on numerous occasions purchased food and other essentials for my children, and my ex-wife’s grandmother can attest to this fact. “I am not employed on a permanent basis and earn approximately US$7 per day through part-time work, and I am therefore offering a maintenance payment of US$30 per month,” he said.   Ms Gumbo ordered him to contribute US$50 for the two children’s upkeep.   "

Weekender Reporter A MUTARE woman — Mutembesi Makarawo — filed for a protection order against her ex-husband, Blessing Matidza, accusing him of insulting and assaulting her. The two appeared before Mutare magistrate, Ms Purity Gumbo who refused to grant the protection order. “Your Worship, my ex-husband and I have been separated for two years. Three weeks ago, he violently assaulted me after discovering a message in my cellphone. The abuse he inflicted on me was so vicious. “Even during the course of our marriage, his tendency towards violence was a constant source of fear and distress. I cannot continue to live with the threat of his unpredictable and dangerous behaviour. I am here today to seek protection from the court against his relentless aggression,” she said. Makarawo further alleged that she was staying with her parents together with their two children “For our safety, I went back to my parents’ house in Gimboki. Leaving my children in his care was simply not an option, given his volatility and propensity for violence. My parents, too, have made it clear that they are fed up with him. He last assaulted me when I was out running a simple errand to get groceries for my family. The abuse has left me feeling terrified and vulnerable, with nowhere else to turn, but the court,” she said. Responding to the allegations, Matidza argued that the two are still together under the same roof even though they had formally separated. “Your worship, I oppose this application for a protection order because my ex-wife and I are still in a relationship. She visits my house frequently, even today she was there. While I acknowledge that I assaulted her in the past, but it was not in public like she said. She had come to my house when I saw messages from her ex-boyfriend. I apologised for my behaviour and I am committed to changing my ways. “I believe that my ex-wife is using this court process as a way of hiding the fact that we are still together from her parents. They no longer approve our relationship,” he said. Ms Gumbo sternly warned Makarawo against abusing the court process to suit her needs, and threw out her application. “It appears to me that you are attempting to manipulate the court process to suit your own needs. You say that you are still in a relationship with your ex-husband, yet you are seeking a protection order against him. “You claimed that he assaulted you, but you continue to visit his house. I think it is quite possible that your actions are motivated by your desire to keep your relationship with your ex-husband hidden from your family,” she said as she turned down the application.   "

Mapako (40), of Kanduna Village, under Chief Makoni was found dead in a well having allegedly taken his own life after clashing with his employer, Titus Muzamhindo. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka confirmed the incident, saying the now late Mapako confided his frustrations to his wife, Farisai Simira, before taking his life. “Around 6pm on April 21, Mapako and his wife, Farisai Simira, were sharing a meal in their dining room when he opened up to her about his discontentment with his employer — Titus Muzamhindo,” he said. According to Farisai, Mapako felt disrespected and unfairly treated by his boss, and expressed his frustration over the situation. The discussion appeared like a simple conversation between the couple, but little did she know that it marked the beginning of a tragic turn of events that would ultimately lead to her hubby’s demise. “On the same night around 7pm, Farisai retired to bed, leaving her husband in the dining room. The following morning around 5am, Ropafadzo Ndleve (39) went to the well to fetch water, and on arrival she saw it open. “She noticed some shoes that she recognised as belonging to Mapako.

Weekender Reporter FRUSTRATED by her brother’s meddling with her tenants saw a Mutare woman approaching Mutare Civil Court, praying for a protection order. Grace Guti applied for a protection order against her brother, Justine Guti, accusing him of interfering with her tenants’ stay at their family house. The two appeared before Mutare magistrate, Mr Xavier Chipato who granted the protection order to Grace. “Your worship, we inherited the property in Greenside and decided to lease it out. We divided the rooms and we have separate tenants. Each one of us collect rentals from our respective tenants. “We agreed that neither of us should interfere with the other’s tenants, and that we would handle our respective responsibilities independently. However, my brother has been meddling with my tenants, causing a great deal of confusion and frustration. As a result, I have decided to take this matter to court so that he stops what he is doing,” said Grace. Adding on to the allegations, Grace said her brother assaults and insults her. “At one point, we had a fight following a misunderstanding over the tenants. He came home drunk and shouted at me. I confronted him and we ended up fighting. I was injured on the forehead and the scar is still there. I am fed up with his wayward behaviour,” stated Grace. Responding to the allegations, Justine defended himself, arguing that Grace was the aggressor and does not respect him.   “I moved out of the house, leaving her with the tenants, hers and mine. We could not stay under the same roof because she disrespects me. She calls me names. We fought after her daughter called me by my first name. When I tried to counsel her daughter against calling me by my first name, she verbally attacked me. We fought and she also inflicted a scar on me. “Your worship, we are just two siblings, but she does not respect me as her elder brother. She harasses my tenants and I end up retaliating on her own tenants. Many of my tenants have left because of her behaviour and what she says to them,” said Justine. Mr Chipato advised the siblings to stay in union as a family. “You are siblings, and the only close family members. I urge you to maintain peace and develop agape love towards one another,” said Mr Chipato.   "

Calisto Mashava (34), of Bairo Mugoriyondo, Machipanda, Mozambique and Moses Machipanda (34), of Bairo Chicueia, Machipanda, Mozambique, recently appeared before Mutare provincial magistrate, Mr Tendai Mahwe and pleaded guilty to the offence, and were each sentenced to an effective 10 years in jail. Miss Tinotenda Muzondo prosecuted. The court heard that on April 15, at around 4pm, the two skipped the border through an undesignated entry point near Marymount Teachers’ College in Mutare. They proceeded to Green Valley Farm, Odzi where they stayed at the shops until sunset. Miss Muzondo said on the same day around 9pm, the two proceeded to Green Valley Farm grapes fields. Upon arrival, they got to a ZESA power line and disconnected electricity from the power line using a metal object tied with a rope. They went to the transformer in the fields and cut its electric cables. The court also heard that on the same evening, an informant who is the foreman noticed that there was a power cut at the farm, but thought it was due to load-shedding. He decided to go to the grapes fields to check on the progress. Upon arrival at the fields, he saw the two accused persons at the transformer. He called for backup from the security personnel at the farm. They teamed up and approached the two Mozambican nationals. Upon realising that they had been spotted, the Mozambican duo fled into different directions, but Mashava was apprehended. Machipanda disappeared into the darkness to an unknown destination. Mashava was handed over to ZRP Odzi where he was detained. The next day, Mashava was handed over to CID Minerals Flora and Fauna Mutare for further management. He was interviewed and detectives took his phone and used it to contact Machipanda. Machipanda informed Mashava that he had escaped to Mutare and was waiting for him at the Victoria Chitepo Provincial Hospital Bus Stop. Mashava led the detectives to the bus stop and Machipanda was subsequently arrested. A search was carried out on in the satchel that Machipanda was carrying leading to the recovery of a 15-metres long blue rope tied with a metal deformed ring at one end, a hacksaw, two hacksaw blades, a cutter, knife, thread tape and three empty 50kg bags.
The total value stolen is US$1 000 and all was recovered. The recovered ZESA equipment is to be returned to the institution, while the implements used to commit the offence were forfeited to the State. On April 17, the Department of Immigration was advised of the arrest of the accused persons. The accused were issued with warrants for detention issued in terms of Section 10 of the Immigration Act 1979. The accused persons were also issued with warrants for further detention issued in terms of Section 8 (2) (b) of the Immigration Act 1979. The Department of Immigration also issued the magistrate with certificates of evidence in terms of Section 40 (1) of the Immigration Act (Chapter 4:02). Upon completion of serving their sentence, the two accused persons are to be handed over to the Department of Immigration for deportation. In a separate, yet similar case of theft of public infrastructure, a Rusape man who endangered the lives of railway travellers by stealing track signal poles was recently slapped with a 10-year jail term by a local magistrate. Farai Moyo was convicted of contravening the Railways Act, and sentenced to an effective 10 years in jail. He had pleaded not guilty when he appeared before Rusape magistrate, Mrs Barbara Mateko.

All of Moyo’s accomplices are still at large. “The four uprooted the signal poles and left them hidden in a bush along the railway line. A patrol officer on duty noticed that the poles had been removed and found them hidden in a nearby bush. He informed his superior who reported the matter to the police,” said Ms Dhliwayo. The patrol officer and another NRZ employee were joined by police officers and they set up an ambush at the crime scene. “Two days later, and at around 4am, Moyo and his accomplices arrived at the scene driving a five-tonne truck. Kasasa who was driving, parked the vehicle and switched off the lights. The other three started loading the signal poles into the truck. They were intercepted by the police. They ran away after warning shots were fired into the air. The police officers also shot the vehicle’s tyres and the suspects left it behind,” she said. After the police recovered the vehicle, they searched it, and found a wallet containing Kasasa’s particulars, and a satchel which contained two hacksaws, hacksaw blades, together with some clothes and shoes. Moyo was arrested the following day after was identified by the patrol officer during the ambush. The NRZ was prejudiced of property worth US$2 300 and all was recovered. In passing sentence, Mrs Mateko said the severity of the gang’s actions could not be understated.   "

Post Reporter A MUTARE woman residing in Cape Town, South Africa, is on the run after allegedly scalding her husband with cooking oil over money meant for her lobola. The two reportedly clashed over the money, leading to the tragic death of the husband, Mr Moses Mtukwa, who succumbed to injuries sustained in the attack at a Cape Town hospital last Thursday. Mr Mtukwa (41) was hospitalised for two weeks and was on life-support before passing on, according to his older brother, Mr Davison Mtukwa. In an interview with The Manica Post, Mr Davison Mtukwa said after Moreblessing Nyakunu (40) scalded his brother with cooking oil, she stole 31 000 Rand and US$800 that her husband was saving to pay her bride price and disappeared. “My brother died due to the serious injuries he sustained after being scalded with cooking oil. What hurts most is that Nyakunu did not inform us that our brother was in hospital. Instead, each time we called him or her, she would answer the calls and pretended as if everything was fine. Each time my sister who is also in South Africa called looking for Moses, Nyakunu would tell her that he (Moses) was at home, while she was at work,” he said.    Tinashe Nyakunu, brother to Moreblessing Davison said they only got to know that their brother was in hospital five days after his admission when a well-wisher who had rushed him to the hospital contacted their sister. “When my sister got there, she was immediately told by the hospital authorities that Moses was supposed to be put on life-support system, and we had to run around looking for money for him to receive medical attention. At that time, Moses was still talking, and he told our sister that he had 31 000 Rand and US$800 at home. He said the money was meant to pay for Nyakunu’s bride price. He once told me about his savings, and we were planning to visit the Nyakunu family to settle some of the lobola arrears,” he said. Davison said when their sister went to Moses’ home, it was deserted and the money was nowhere to be found as Nyakunu had fled with it. “My brother and Nyakunu had a child together while they were still staying in Bvirindi Village under Chief Zimunya back then. They, however, parted ways and we were surprised to hear that he was cohabiting with her when he migrated to South Africa. They both came back home and he paid part of the bride price for her. Up until now, we never heard of any altercation between them. They appeared the most perfect couple to us. We were shocked to hear of this tragedy. “My brother told our sister before he was put on life-support that Nyakunu had scalded him because she wanted to use the lobola money for something else. After scalding him, neighbours rushed him to the hospital. She disappeared with the money. Up to now, South African police are looking for her because she committed a heinous crime,” he said.   The family has in its possession WhatsApp messages and audios sent between the couple hours prior to the commission of the heinous crime. In the chats, Nyakunu stated that she wanted to use the money for something else, and Moses had to give it to her, and look for the lobola money later. The Mutukwa family is now appealing to well-wishers to help them raise 17 000 Rand required for the repatriation of the deceased’s body for burial. “27 000 Rand is what is needed in total, and as a family we have managed to raise 10 000 Rand. Had she not stolen the money, we would have been able to bring back home our loved one, and lay him to his final resting place. We are unable to do that at the moment. We are appealing to Zimbabwe, family and friends to help us so that our brother’s remains are brought home,” said the man. Efforts to contact Moreblessing Nyakunu on WhatsApp were fruitless as her phone was unreachable. When The Manica Post visited the Nyakunu homestead in Bvirindi Village on Tuesday afternoon, Moreblessing’s mother, Mrs Loveness Nyakunu and her two sisters were struggling to come to terms with the tragedy.    Mbuya Loveness Nyakunu, mother to Moreblessing Mrs Nyakunu described her daughter as a moody and violent person. “I do not want to lie, Moreblessing is a violent person and always clashed with her sisters, but we never thought that things would come to this. We never thought she would murder her husband and I was shocked when I heard of this sad development. I passed out and had to be rushed to the clinic where I was resuscitated,” said the elderly woman.
She said they approached the Mtukwa family on Monday to extend their condolences. “When my daughter last called me, she said she had an altercation with her husband and he was admitted in hospital. Since then, her phones have been off and we cannot reach her. What she has done has left us in a big mess. I do not know how we will be able to raise the money that the Mtukwa family wants for the body to be repatriated to Zimbabwe,” she said amid sobs. Moreblessing’s brother, Mr Tinashe Nyakunu said they are also looking for her. “Moreblessing should come out of hiding and face the music. Yes, she erred, but she is still our sibling. She should surrender herself to the authorities so that the world knows the truth,” he said. He also appealed to well-wishers to help them raise funds to repatriate Moses’ body. For assistance, Mr Davison Mtukwa can be contacted on +263774411748.   Those willing to help with cash can also send money to his EcoCash US$ account on that sme number.   "

Senior Reporter OLD age think-tanks once wrote that looters don’t read, and readers don’t loot, but the unabated and alarming rate of mineral leakages, especially diamonds, lithium and gold, across the country and Manicaland in particular, is just too difficult to ignore. Ideally, mineral leakages are predominantly in the gold sub-sector and other precious and semi-precious stones like diamonds through smuggling and diversion to the informal market.   Experts estimate that the country could be losing billions of United States of America dollars annually through leakages. In the gold and lithium sub-sectors, of late, there have been reports of smuggling of minerals to countries such as South Africa, Dubai and China. Diamonds, for example, after being stolen from companies operating in the nearby Marange area, find a ready market in several buyers of foreign origin resident in some of Mutare’s leafy suburbs. A check by The Manica Post revealed that several foreign nationals, some with tertiary student status permits to justify their presence in the country, have set base in suburbs like Murambi, Morningside, Greenside and Fairbridge Park.   Gold buyers have also thronged Penhalonga area near Mutare where the mineral is sold in piecemeal to Fidelity Printers — the formal trend — but a considerable amount is reportedly being smuggled out of the country. In addition, it has also been reported that semi-precious stones discovered in some parts of the country like Hurungwe and Karoi in Mashonaland West Province where villagers extracted the stones without going through the normal processes that ensure Zimbabwe benefits as a nation, are allegedly smuggling the minerals. In an interview on the sidelines of the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development two-day workshop in Vumba last week, chairman of the Portfolio Committee, Honourable Joseph Msipa said they are seized with the matter of minerals leakage. “We are indeed concerned about the leakage of minerals as a committee. This is the reason why we will soon be calling for an indaba where we will bring together relevant stakeholders so that we map the way forward as a team. We are putting forward our suggestion as a committee to see the improvement of security on minerals in the country, and we hope we will achieve what we aspire to,” said the Shurugwi North parliamentarian. In a separate interview, speaking from a mining employees representative view, tough talking Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Union (ZFTU) secretary general, Cde Kennias Shamuyarira, said: “We have a well-orchestrated mafia extractive syndicate, right from some unscrupulous Government officials, colluding with the so-called investors at the expense of the working class and the majority citizenry. “Real economic development in a country can only be realised when we have radical policies on beneficiation and value addition to all our minerals and other natural resources.”   After extraction, gemstones such as amethyst, aquamarine, and garnet are illegally sold to unscrupulous dealers who smuggle and export the semi-precious and coloured stones in their raw form.   Cde Shamuyarira added: “I think we need to be very frank and candid to each other as a country and as a people. The whole issue starts from the investor, who comes into our space here in Zimbabwe, coming to invest in diamond, platinum or gold mining. “All the other countries that developed or are on the development path, they (investors) go there fully aware that they will put something and get something out of their initiative, and the people in the country they will be investing in, will also get something. “But our situation is so absurd. It is very skewed in the sense that you take a company like the now defunct Mbada Diamonds, they came with their machinery and expertise and all that we benefitted was employment of general hand workers. “Over and above that, there was no beneficiation. You cannot talk of beneficiation by a company of that magnitude when they built houses for displaced villagers. That was a prerequisite just like protective clothing for employees.”   Cde Shamuyarira said beneficiation should be noticed from the production of the end products, and not export of raw minerals as a way of also addressing rampant leakages of mineral. “The diamond was mined and is being mined, but there is no beneficiation. We should be having a polishing site where we employ people. After polishing diamonds, we must have the end product of rings, bracelets and so on. “That is what we call beneficiation, and once we have that we can curb leakages. “These diamonds are taken raw as they are to other people who know how to beneficiate our resources. This is why our theme for Workers Day this year touches on confronting extractive and parasitic investment. “These are the kinds of investments we are talking about whereby the country itself does not benefit and the employees do not benefit at all. You look at the salaries that people are being paid in these mines, it’s a pittance, save for the few middle management that serve the interest of the shareholders. “The rest are being paid amounts under the Poverty Datum Line and are wallowing in abject poverty, without any healthcare and education benefits. Overal, we do not see us as a country benefiting anything from these investments, simply because we do not have the end product being produced here,” he said. The gathering in Vumba was meant to establish a strong foundation for collaboration between MMCZ and the Parliamentary Committee, while equipping participants with a comprehensive understanding of the MMCZ’s mandate, strategic direction, and current operations. MMCZ was established to monitor and promote the export of all minerals produced in Zimbabwe with the exception of gold and silver which are dealt with by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.   Zimbabwe has 60 different mineral products, half of them currently being exported, but the country has been losing revenue from these minerals export owing to leakages at porous ports of exit such as Forbes Border Post in Mutare. While MMCZ has been monitoring movement of minerals from production site, with their inspectors operating within mineral producing sites, and partially through the export process, they have not been allowed to be stationed at the country’s ports of exit under the excuse that their presence would militate against ease of doing business. In their contribution during the MMCZ Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development workshop, a number of Members of Parliament emphasized the need to have MMCZ presence felt. Mutare North Member of the House of Assembly Cde Admire Mahachi said. “There is need to have MMCZ present at the place where minerals are getting outside the country. This is their actual job. Their job is not primarily in the offices, but in the field and the border is one place where they have to ensure that the country is not losing anything though their presence,” he said. Headlands Member of House of Assembly, Cde Farai Mapfumo said the country must not sacrifice the God-given minerals on the altar of ease of doing business. “Yes, we need to be seen to be facilitating the ease of doing business. No one denies that. However, we should not be seen to be sacrificing the God-given minerals on the altar of ease of doing business. “There are ways that can certainly be worked out to ensure that we secure our minerals, while at the same time provide ease of doing business for our visitors or investors.
“MMCZ should be right at the border and given space to operate without necessarily hindering the smooth flow of business at a given border post,” he said. Ideally, minerals are a finite resource that needs to be utilised for the benefit of the nation when extracted. Apart from being finite, the international prices of minerals fluctuate, further buttressing the need to utilise extracted minerals when they still have value. For example, the acute down spiraling of tantalite prices on the international market has resulted in the sudden disappearance of both local and foreign mining investors who had invaded Buhera District. Fielding questions from Members of the House of Assembly during the Vumba workshop, MMCZ’s corporate’s marketing manager, Mr Gumisai Nenzou said: “There is a fluctuation of the prices of minerals that we actively market as MMCZ. For example, there was once a hype around tantalite mining in Buhera District here in Manicaland. The demand was spurred by cellphone manufacturing clients who needed the product. “We saw numerous tantalite mining bases being set up in Buhera, and at the time tantalite was going for US$1 200 per kilogramme. Today, the same product has drastically gone down to US$100 for the same weight. “Given the production costs and other mining related expenses, it might no longer make any business sense, hence the disappearance of those who were mining it in Buhera,” said Mr Nenzou.   "

Senior Reporter CRIMINAL gangs wielding machetes have resurfaced in Mutare, pouncing on unsuspecting residents especially in low density areas in the dead of the night — a few months after such cases had subsided. The Manica Post has learnt that a 38-year-old woman had the unwelcome visitors at her Murambi East home in the wee hours of Monday. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka, confirmed the incident, and said the victim, Ms Lucia Masiya was struck by a machete by two unknown assailants in her Murambi East house. “The incident happened on Monday around 3am in Murambi East, Mutare. The complainant, Ms Lucia Masiya (38) heard noise from her children’s room, and went to investigate. “She met two unknown men who struck her using the flat side of the machete before escaping with two cellphones, an Itel 516 Pro, Huawei Honor 5A and a 14-inch Keson television set. However, the television set was dropped on their way out of the premise,” he said. Assistant Inspector Chinyoka urged residents in leafy suburbs of Mutare to intensify security at their homes. He said the police have also increased patrols in the area. “We would like to urge residents in leafy suburbs of Mutare to intensify security around their homes because indications are that machete gangs are back. “As the police, we are also increasing our presence in these suburbs. We are using our dog section, Ferret teams as well as motorised patrols,” he said. Assistant Inspector Chinyoka bemoaned the behaviour of some residents in these suburbs who deliberately leave their windows open. “It is sad that while we are trying to protect residents and their properties, we have noticed during patrols that some of them leave their windows open, while some gather outside their homes on account of hot weather,” he said.   "

Post Correspondent UNSUSPECTING people desperately seeking to travel to the Diaspora in search of greener pastures are falling victims to a syndicate of bogus travel agents that are swindling them of their hard earned money, and a suspect — Bridget Mugunha of Rusape — was arrested for fleecing a job seeker US$2 500. Magunha (26), of Tsanzaguru in Rusape, allegedly misled Bruce Gwangwara into believing that she had secured him a work permit at a company in Poland, and demanded US$2 500 for the said services. Magunha, who was represented by Mr Munyaradzi Manyengavana, of Manyengavana Law Chambers, was not asked to plead when she appeared before magistrate, Mrs Patience Chirimo, who granted her US$100 bail with reporting conditions. Prosecutor, Mr Takunda Muzenda said Magunha informed Gwangwara that she had sorted all his papers, and advised him to proceed to the Polish Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa where it emerged that the papers were counterfeit. “The accused is a self-styled travel agent based in Rusape, and on a date unknown to the prosecutor, but between November and December 2023, she misrepresented to Gwangwara that she could facilitate a work permit and travel documents for him to travel to Poland. “Magunha charged Gwangwara US$2 500 for the job. The accused took the US$2 500, and gave the complainant some documents purporting that it was a work permit for him to obtain a visa to travel to Poland. “Gwangwara travelled to the Polish Embassy in Pretoria in a bid to get the visa, only to be told that his documents were fake and his application was declined. “Copies of the alleged work permit with the particulars of a Polish employer and the name of the complainant as employee given to the complainant by the accused person is available as evidence. Value of the cash defrauded is US$2 500, and nothing was recovered,” said Mr Muzenda. The matter was adjourned to April 22 for trial.   "
