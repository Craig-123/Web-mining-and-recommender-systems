Senior Reporter AGRICULTURAL activities across Manicaland have been the biggest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) earner for the province, with a total output of ZWL$8.42 billion, a realisation that is now influencing Government’s renewed value addition drive for produce from all the seven districts. Provincial GDP measures economic activity at provincial level to facilitate decision-making and policy evaluation. Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZimStat) produces provincial GDP estimates annually. In his presentation during the National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) engagement which brought together Government and the private sector, comprising captains of industry, academia, local authorities and business executives in Manicaland at a local hotel yesterday (Thursday), ZimStat’s manager (national accounts department), Mr Grown Chirongwe, said: “The 2022 value added for agriculture at constant prices (wholesaling and retailing) was estimated at ZWL$4.33 billion and ZWL$4.09 billion, respectively. “The value added for mining and manufacturing was estimated at ZWL$3.18 billion and ZWL$2.30 billion, respectively. Agriculture had the highest contribution (19.9 percent) to Manicaland Provincial GDP owing to vibrant forestry and horticultural activities (in Honde Valley, Nyanga, Chipinge and Chimanimani). Furthermore, the production of milk and fishing is also contributing much to the industry. “Wholesale and retailing activities accounted for 18.8 percent of the provincial GDP. Activity is mainly concentrated in Mutare, Rusape and Chipinge towns. “14.6 percent of the provincial GDP was generated from the mining industry. This was mainly driven by extraction activities in Chiadzwa (diamond), Penhalonga and Nyanga (gold) and Phosphate (dorowa). “Manufacturing recorded 10.5 percent, with much of the activity being witnessed in the manufacturing of groceries (Mega Market), timber products (Border Timbers, Wattle Company and Allied Timbers as the main players), oxygen manufacturing (Verify Engineering) and Delta Beverages (Rusape and Mutare).” In an interview on the sidelines of the NECF engagement, Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza said: “Manicaland is a land of milk and honey, but that honey needs to be tapped and value added. You will discover that in every district, we have got what it takes to establish factories or plants that can add value to the farm produce. “We are now geared to embark on an intensive value addition of all our agricultural produce in all the seven districts of Manicaland Province. “Already, we have macadamia crushing equipment that is now operational in Chipinge, but we feel we need much more, given the high levels of macadamia production that is going on in Chipinge. In Chimanimani, we have Allied Timbers’ state-of-the-art timber milling plant, and we have been approached by other investors that want to put up other plants there. “In Mutare, we have plants that are value adding baobab fruit. At Mutare Teachers’ College we have a plant that will soon be commissioned by His Excellency, President Mnangagwa that will produce Wasu Juice from the baobab fruit. “We have the same lined up for Honde Valley where we have many fruits and vegetables that are being produced, and plans are underway that we have a plant that will carry out drying and processing of these products. “The same applies for Nyanga where we have potatoes and apples. In Makoni, we have an investor who has approached us with the aim of having a tobacco processing plant. Instead of our farmers taking their produce to Harare, we are anticipating that soon they will be providing their produce to a local processing company.” In a separate interview, NECF Steering Committee co-chairperson, Dr Mike Bimha, said: “Zimbabwe is known for its intellectuals, and it is high time we transform this intellect into tangible development. “This is the gap that the NECF is geared to cover, and ensure that we develop as a nation, without any place and any person being left behind. This initiative is meant to allow provinces to take ownership in generating their own GDP.” NECF’s acting executive secretary, Mr Muzi Muzite said: “The Manicaland NEFC Development Dialogue is the first of a series of similar engagements that will take place across the country. The aim is to let all stakeholders give input into the GDP of the province up to national level, and ensure that every citizen plays a part in the development discourse of the country. “Ultimately, all the ideas will be factored into the national policy formulation, and that means whatever we get here and all other provinces will be factored into the National Development Strategy (NDS2), which is the next blueprint that the country will embark on as we journey towards Vision 2023, as espoused and instructed by our principal, President Mnangagwa.” The Manicaland Provincial Development Dialogue programme was held under the theme: “Towards inclusive socio-economic transformation: Leaving no one and no place behind.” The NECF is a public private dialogue convener established in July 1997 after lessons learnt during a trip to Malaysia by former President Mugabe where the delegation witnessed host Government, business, labour and civil society coming together to discuss issues of national importance in an unfettered environment. Since its establishment, the NECF played a crucial role in policy formation.   "

Post Correspondent GOVERNMENT in partnership with the Swedish Embassy, rolled out lucrative and inclusive commercial horticulture and mushroom economic projects in two districts, resulting in the creation of thousands of job, while fusing women and youths into well-meaning economic activities. The programme, funded to the tune of US$4. 6 million, is being administered by Gender Links Zimbabwe, and has two lucrative projects in Manicaland —which include a massive greenhouse at Masvosva, in Makoni West Constituency and a viable mushroom venture in Chikanga suburb of Mutare. In other parts of the country, funds were availed for waste management, clean energy and market facilities projects, which have overwhelmingly transformed beneficiaries’ livelihoods. Speaking at the commissioning the two Manicaland projects on Wednesday, Local Government and Public Works Minister, Honourable Daniel Garwe said the programme is in tandem with the country’s vision of creating an upper middle economy where all citizens lead decent lives. Minister Garwe said by promoting gender-inclusive local economic development, the initiative is creating a just and equitable society where everyone has an opportunity to succeed. “This transformative initiative marks a pivotal step towards reducing poverty and enhancing livelihoods through gender-responsive and inclusive local economic development in 12 centres of excellence for gender centres in local government. The vision for this programme is to create a society where women, youths and men have equal opportunities to contribute to and benefit from economic growth. “On November 1, 2023, President Mnangagwa launched the Local Authorities Blueprint on service delivery towards attainment of Vision 2030. “The blueprint is underpinned by the mantra: “Call to action — no compromise to service delivery”. It is therefore critical to underscore that local authorities as a third tier of Government are a critical stakeholder in achievement of an upper middle-income society by 2030. I am therefore highly elated that Makoni Rural District Council and Mutare City Council contributed towards the success of the Masvosva Greenhouse and Chikanga Mushroom projects respectively which resonates well with the “Call to action — no compromise to service delivery”. “We envision an upper middle income economy by 2030 with local authorities that are empowered to drive economic development that is inclusive, sustainable, and gender-responsive. “Through this programme, viable local economic development flagship enterprises have been established in 12 centres across the country. “These enterprises will serve as models of best practice, showcasing how gender responsive local economic development can drive economic growth and create meaningful opportunities for all. “In each of these 12 local authorities, we have invested in critical infrastructure projects that will support the development of the flagship enterprises. The total value of the project is US$4.6m over three years. The projects include the construction of horticulture infrastructure like greenhouses and mushroom houses. “Waste management facilities were also constructed and relevant equipment as well as clean energy facilities and markets were availed. “The programme will create jobs for 3 600 people in 12 local authorities and provide the much-needed income and improve the livelihoods of families and communities,” said Minister Garwe. Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza welcomed the projects, saying they have made significant impact to the Masvosva and Chikanga communities, addressing multi-faceted challenges. “The overall goal of the programme is to reduce poverty and enhance livelihoods through gender responsive and inclusivity. These initiatives, therefore represent the significant milestone in our commitment to fostering inclusive growth and empowering all members of our society. “The Masvosva Greenhouse and the Chikanga Mushroom House are multi-faceted projects which will assist the province to shoot several birds with one stone. We shall achieve Sustainable Development Goal Number 2 — zero to hunger and Number 5 — gender equality through the implementation of programmes such as these. “The growing and selling of horticultural produce and mushroom serve as a platform for promoting gender equality and empowerment and growing our economy as Manicaland,” he said. Gender Links regional director, Mrs Priscilla Maposa said her organisation poured in a significant amount of money for the projects and the involvement of Government, through local authorities, will make the projects self-sustaining. “For the Masvosva Horticulture Project, we availed US$178 000 — for the construction of the infrastructure, while the Chikanga Mushroom Project was supported with US$76 000. For sustainability, the programme is being implemented in partnership with Government and local authorities. “Councils will take over and run the projects together with communities, capacity building of council officials and beneficiaries is also key for the ownership of the programme. The beneficiaries have developed business plans and models which also outlines how the businesses will be run, flourish and remain in existence even when the funder has weaned off beneficiaries,” she said. Mrs Josephine Makumbe, the secretary of the Masvosva Horticulture Project, said the greenhouse facility has changed the face of the village and transformed their lives for the better. “We are a group of 50 women, youths and men commercially growing horticultural produce in the greenhouse. We have graduated from subsistence to commercial farming — a dream come true for us. The earnings are so encouraging, and we hope to penetrate bigger markets in Harare and Mutare,” said Mrs Makumbe.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/rbz-walks-the-talk-on-fiscal-discipline/,RBZ walks the talk on fiscal discipline,"The ManicaPost   Ray Bande
Senior Reporter “WHAT we are going through as a country is not peculiar to Zimbabwe. At one point Zambia went through a period where their local currency ceased to be the preferred legal tender for the transacting public, but if you go there today, it is different. I went there on a work-related visit, and when I wanted supper, I walked into a restaurant with my US$10. I slept on an empty stomach after they told me to bring their Zambian kwacha”. These were the words of inspiration from Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu while addressing business delegates in Mutare last week. As he answered questions from the delegates, Dr Mushayavanhu emphasised on the need to instil fiscal discipline to extricate the country out of the current economic quagmire.   Fiscal discipline dictates that governments maintain fiscal positions that are consistent with macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth. To this end, it warrants avoiding excessive borrowing and debt accumulation. Accordingly, money supply growth on the market is one pertinent thing that he promised to maintain during his tenure at the Central Bank. “It is an issue that we need to solve once and for all. Previously, our money supply was growing because of what we call quasi-fiscal operations. “Let me explain all this, in case some of you will look at it in bad light. The country was under sanctions and Government could not borrow in its own right. “Lenders who were at least willing to assist us as a country came up with a way to lend to the Central Bank. When you lend to the Central Bank, it is an entity that does not generate income, and the only way it could generate that income was by printing money. “So what would happen is that as those loans were being repaid, the Central Bank would buy foreign currency from the market and credit the exporters’ accounts with RTGS, which in itself is printing money. But it was all for the good of the country. “Most of you were saying they are seeing growth in the economy, yes, it was all because of that,” he said, hence the need to stop the printing of money forthwith. “The Central Bank has pushed some liabilities to treasury, and they are being serviced through tax collections, thereby reducing pressure on it and that is why we say there will be no more money printing, and we mean it,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu noted that some improvements are already happening in the economy. “There has been a lot of retooling. I was in Bulawayo last week. Belmont used to be an industrial hub just after independence. In the last 10 years all those industries had been converted into churches, but in the last three years, the buildings are becoming factories again. There is a lot happening there,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu also emphasised on the need to rebuild trust and confidence on the market. “There is need for policy consistency and restoration of trust and confidence. I am on record saying confidence and trust cannot be legislated. I cannot stand here and say trust me. The only being that you can trust is God. But what we can do best as the Central Bank is to walk the talk. “What we say we will do, we have to do it, and with time people will trust us. That is the journey we have embarked upon. We announced the Monetary Policy Statement on April 5, and have insisted that there will be no flip-flopping,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said to ensure policy consistency, the Central Bank has established a Monetary Policy Monitoring Committee that has come up with a dashboard that tracks every parameter mentioned in the Monetary Policy Statement. “The Monetary Policy Monitoring Committee is looking at it daily, to see if we are complying. It is either green, amber or red. If we are getting near the ceiling, warning bells start ringing and we will do something about it. “Over time you will then come to trust us. Once we perfect this dashboard, we will make it public so that on a month or weekly basis, we will be saying these are the parameters. “The committee will meet on a quarterly basis to take stock as to whether we are living up with the Monetary Policy Statement we would have announced,” he said. He allayed fears that the gold meant to back the new currency was not there. “We showed you the gold that we have because some of you thought that it was a very small portion. Manicaland is a gold producing province and I am sure some, if not all of you have tried to lift various amounts of gold. “In that vault, there is 1.5 tonnes of gold. Another one tonne is offshore and the difference of 250kg was in the form of other minerals like diamonds and so forth, waiting to be converted to gold value,” said Dr Mushayavanhu.   "

Post Correspondent ZIMBABWE has launched its first ever National Forest Policy in response to the climate change phenomenon and continued discretion of natural ecosystems by irresponsible people. The policy comes at a time when the province is facing serious environmental challenges threatening to exterminate some forests, especially in the tobacco growing hubs of Manicaland like Makoni and Mutare districts, which has witnessed the wanton destruction of forests by farmers to cure the golden leaf.   To make the situation worse, illegal settlers have moved into grazing land, national parks, plantations, riverbanks and wetlands, while illegal mining activities are exacerbating the environmental damage through land degradation, deforestation and chemical contamination of water sources. Veld fires continue posing severe threats to the conservation of biodiversity and human life, with newly resettled smallholder farmers perceived as major drivers. Wanton burning of vegetation means reduction in carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, and the smoke from the infernos produce huge amounts of carbon dioxide, which is the greenhouse gas causing global warming. Forests burning is a single largest contributor to greenhouse gases in the dry season. The infernos chew pastures, leaving land without vegetative cover and livestock without pastures, resulting in reduced returns to farmers due to poor beef quality, low milk production and poor market prices for the animals.   Regardless of promulgation of several laws aimed at preventing fires, the infernos remain a perennial problem. Manicaland is home to an assortment of natural rainforests, which must be protected from wanton deforestation for future generations to benefit from. The province commands massive timber plantations which provide lifeline to the timber industry and employing thousands of people.   Environment, Climate and Wildlife Minister, Dr Sithembiso Nyoni last week said trees and forests are an integral part of a production system that drives social and economic development. “Zimbabwe’s first National Forest Policy seeks to promote sustainable management of forests as a national heritage, through the provision of an enabling environment conducive for all the stakeholders involved in the forest resources management.   This cogent policy framework allows for effective participation to foster socio-economic development through sustainable management and utilisation of various goods and services that come from trees and forests. “The objective of the forest policy is to maximise the conversation and sustainable management of forests towards improved environmental protection. There are multiple benefits that locals derive from intensification of forest development in the context of non-timber forest products and reducing carbon emissions. The next decades, will place nature as a defence line against the vagaries of climate change,” said Minister Nyoni. She added: “The policy development adopted an inclusive approach informed by national stakeholders to design actions that are people centred in forest management. In line with Government’s vision of economic growth and sustainable development enshrined in the National Development Strategies and the 2030 National Vision, the National Forest Policy makes emphasis on promoting conversation and sustainable management of forests in all categories of forest tenure systems to enhance the forest resource base, ensure ecosystem stability and provision of basic environmental services.” Environmental activist and national trees ambassador, Mr Never Bonde said the afforestation and reforestation culture must be inculcated in the minds of citizens. “This policy comes at the right time when forests across the country are under siege from deforestation. In Manicaland, we are witnessing the rampant cutting down of indigenous trees, especially by tobacco farmers, while minute efforts are being made towards afforestation and reforestation. “Forests must be used sustainably, and it is every citizen’s role and responsibility to plant trees. We understand that the majority still use wood as a source of energy, but they should also plant trees. Let us stick to the ‘you cut one, plant two’ principle,” said Mr Bonde. Save the Environment and Climate Foundation Trust executive director, Mr Learnmore Nyaruwanga said the policy will get buy-in from stakeholders as it has direct benefits for communities.   “We believe this policy will go a long way in addressing forestry management issues. The concept of including orchards in forestry programmes is also vital, as they play a double effect by providing nutritious fruits, while being sinkers. Most communities will embrace this concept as it provides direct benefits to them.“Tobacco farmers and contractors must also be taken on board as they are negatively impacting on the forests,” said Mr Nyaruwanga.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/zig-meant-to-cushion-workers-minister/,ZiG meant to cushion workers: Minister,"The ManicaPost   Ray Bande 
Senior Reporter THE recent introduction of the new currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) was meant to cushion workers and retain the value of their wages, Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza has said. Minister Mugadza said this in his address at the Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions’ Workers Day commemorations held on Wednesday at Jopa Junction, in Chipinge. Workers’ Day is celebrated annually on May 1 as International Workers’ Day or May Day, to pay tribute to the historical struggle of workers and their trade unions for solidarity and fair employment standards.   This year’s global theme is: “Ensure Workplace Safety and Health Amidst Climate Change”. “The commemoration of Workers’ Day is a recognition of the key role of workers in socio-economic development. Thus, workers should be seen as a vital cog in the socio-economic transformative agenda as we journey towards sustainable economic growth. “Government is aware that this Workers’ Day is being commemorated at a time when the country is faced with economic challenges characterised by high levels of inflation that are constantly eroding workers’ income and negatively impacting on the livelihood of Zimbabweans. “This requires us to work together as Government, business and the workers. Government recently introduced new measures to tackle hyperinflation and currency depreciation. One significant move is the introduction of structured currency known as Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG). This initiative underscores our dedication to protecting the purchasing power of worker’s wages and salaries amidst rising inflationary pressures. By shielding workers from the adverse impact of inflation, Government wants to ensure that their earnings retain workers’ value and reliability, providing them with the much-needed assurance and stability,” Advocate Mugadza.   Speaking during the same function, Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions president, Mr Afred Makwarimba said: “Thorough consultation with the working class must be made in all economic activities in the country. The working class should not be used to rubber stamp neo-liberal policies. All economic policies should go through the Tripartite Negotiating Forum before being implemented. Workers are the vanguards of the economy. “Our economic policies must benefit the majority and not a tiny coterie of wealthy elites. Government should align itself with the workers. Workers are the real creators of the wealth.” In his address at the same function, Chief Director in the Ministry of Public Works, Labour and Social Welfare, Mr Clifford Matorera said Government respects workers’ rights and will do everything to honour them. “Government respects workers’ rights, and believe that their rights should be honoured. We want workers to get salaries that can cater for all their needs. This is the reason why Government introduced a new currency recently so that workers can get something tangible out of their efforts at work. We also implore employers to treat their employees fairly and this is the reason why we as Government are part of Workers’ Day commemorations,” he said.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/rbz-outlines-de-dollarisation-roadmap/,RBZ outlines de-dollarisation roadmap,"The ManicaPost   Ray Bande
Senior Reporter RESERVE Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu has expressed optimism that the country’s de-dollarisation thrust will succeed, amid projections that the foreign currency black market that is notorious for fuelling exchange rate volatility, inflation and macro-economic stability will gradually die before 2030. De-dollarisation is a process of moving away from the reliance on USD as the chief transacting currency to the newly introduced Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG). RBZ, a fortnight ago, unveiled ZiG as part of several policy measures to address exchange rate volatility, curtail inflation and restore macro-economic stability in the country. ZiG will circulate alongside a basket of other currencies, and the public has up to April 30 to convert their Zimbabwe dollars to the new currency. ZiG’s value will be secured by both the quantity and worth of gold and other precious metals, along with foreign currency reserves. Fielding questions during a Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) breakfast meeting held in Mutare yesterday, Dr Mushayavanhu said currently 80 percent of transactions in the country are being done in USD, but the gradual de-dollarisation process will see the margins being reduced on year-to-year basis. “The market is dollarised to the extent that 80 percent of all transactions currently happening in the country are in USD, and only 20 percent are in local currency. Government has said 50 percent of transactions should be done in local currency, so they are well ahead of us. “The Central Bank has come up with a roadmap towards de-dollarisation, and as we go towards 2030, we want to do it gradually so that maybe by the end of the year, we are at 70/30, in 2025 we are at 60/40, then in 2026 we are at 50/50 and after that we will not even care to monitor it because it will happen on its own. “You will also be seeing Government reviewing the amount you pay in ZiG for tax as we go along on that roadmap,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said the imaginary USD parallel market rates being talked about are non-existent. “As far as the parallel market is concerned, some of these rates that you are hearing are mere quotations. We have tested this system ourselves. As you know we have the Financial Intelligence Unit, and we unleashed them on the market to pose as forex buyers. For example, we tasked them to buy US$100 000 at whatever rate, and they were ready to pay. The FIU team requested to see the US$ first before transferring the funds in the individuals’ bank accounts. From 8am to 8pm they were saying we will avail the money, and at the end of the day nothing materialised. “If these transactions are happening for US$5 and US$10 for people who want to buy airtime, then it is normal in any economy. I don’t think we have a parallel market for meaningful business transactions,” he said. Asked why they have roped in the police to help curb the parallel market by arresting street money changers, Dr Mushayavanhu said the law enforcement agents are there to promote the rule of law and order. “But having said that, people are also saying why are the police being heavy handed in dealing with forex currency traders. From where we sit as a Central Bank, anyone who is trading in forex should have a licence. It is the duty of the police to intervene and arrest those committing offences. The police are there to arrest them because it is illegal for them to sell or buy forex without a licence. “You will be arrested if you do that. If you try to sell your tomatoes just outside this hotel, the municipal police will arrest you because that is not acceptable. The same is happening to illegal foreign currency dealers,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said the parallel market will eventually die a natural death during the course of the de-dollarisation roadmap. “As the Central Bank, we think that the parallel market will die a natural death,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said estimated income tax is paid on quarterly instalments – (QPDS) quarterly payment dates – March, June, September and December. Dr Mushayavanhu said ZiG is not only strengthening, but stabilising. “ZiG is a new currency fully backed by gold and other precious minerals. We are projecting that ZiG will be stable. The exchange rate will not move. In fact, if you look at what has been happening from April 5, ZiG has been strengthening. “The market has been influenced by the price of gold that has been going up which means that ZiG should naturally strengthen because its major anchor is gold. That is not because the Central Bank has been interfering with the process or has said anything,” he said. The RBZ chief said they are engaging fuel suppliers so that fuel can be purchased using ZiG, and the outcome of the engagements will soon be made public. “On the issue of ZiG buying petroleum products, we are currently seized with negotiations with players in the industry so that it becomes a possibility. We should also be aware that players in that industry are also corporate citizens, and come June they will also have to remit to Government their QPDs in ZiG,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu said payments to contractors for food imports and civil servants have nothing to do with runaway parallel market rates. “Contractors are paid by Government mostly in USD. If they are paid in ZiG, it is from the stock of local currency reserves in the treasury, and not that money is being printed specifically for that. Treasury cannot borrow to pay contractors. If they are using money that is already in circulation, which is controlled, I do not see how that can cause ripples. “As regards to food imports in a semi-dollarised economy, 80 percent of transactions are in USD. What it means is that for you and me, our food requirements, even if it will be imported, it can be done by the private sector. “National Foods can use money in their FCA to import maize-meal and sell it to you in USD because we are in a multi-currency system. The vulnerable ones are covered by the treasury. Yes, the El Nino phenomenon is there, but its impact on the exchange rate and on ZiG is minimal,” he said.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/us450-000-banana-processing-plant-for-hauna/,US$450 000 banana processing plant for Hauna,"The ManicaPost   Tendai Gukutikwa
Post Reporter THE first phase of the construction of the US$450 000 banana powder/flour processing plant at Hauna Growth Point in Mutasa has commenced, and is expected to offer a lasting solution to challenges faced by horticultural producers in the province. The processing plant, the first in Manicaland, will extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by reducing spoilage and increasing the time they can be stored and consumed, making them available year-round by preserving them in different forms such as frozen, canned, or dried.   It will also reduce the risk of food-borne illness by eliminating harmful bacteria and other pathogens as well as reduce food waste by making use of fruits and vegetables that may be too ripe, damaged or unsold in their fresh state. The initiative, poised to directly benefit 600 farmers and provide sustainable support to over 2 000 others from Mutasa, Nyanga and other adjacent districts, was recently announced during a post-Cabinet briefing by Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Dr Jenfan Muswere. Dr Muswere said the project is backed by a US$450 000 grant facilitated by the African Development Bank (AfDB) via the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to the Government. It is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small to Medium Enterprises after securing the land for its construction in 2018. “The project is set to benefit 600 farmers directly and sustain more than 2 000 other farmers from Mutasa, Nyanga and many other districts in Manicaland,” said Dr Muswere. Despite facing delays since its inception in 2018, the project is now gaining momentum, offering enduring solutions to the intricate challenges encountered by horticultural producers in the province. Mutasa District stands out as a major producer of bananas and avocados, among other fruits, yet farmers grapple with numerous obstacles hindering production.
Manicaland provincial development officer in the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small to Medium Enterprises, Mr Gabriel Jaji said the business will not only serve the interests of farmers from Mutasa, but the whole nation. Mr Jaji said the establishment of the plant is expected to primarily empower women and youths in agriculture. “The processing plant was registered successfully, and now the work has started. When all phases of the project are finished, horticulture producers will be linked to lucrative local, regional and international markets,” he said. Mr Jaji said the processing plant will be used to boost economic growth and address challenges currently being faced by horticultural producers in the province. “It will also address market and transport challenges because our farmers have been paying exorbitant transport fares to get to markets in Mutare, Harare or Bulawayo. At the end of the day, their profits were being eroded through exorbitant transport and other costs incurred as they take their produce to the markets in the different cities. “We engaged farmers on the kind of plant they needed, and they suggested the setting up of a banana powder/flour plant. A farmer can sell banana flour for at least US$20 per kilogramme, which is way better than selling raw bananas for peanuts,” he said. Mr Jaji said the processed products will ensure that farmers access high value markets like supermarkets and avoid being ripped off by some unscrupulous middlemen. He also said Government took a leaf from other successful projects already running across the country like the Tasimudzirwa Women’s Gold Milling Plant in Guruve, the Madora Amacimbi Plant in Beitbridge and a tomato processing plant in Mutoko before setting up this project. As expectations mount for its operation, farmers in Mutasa and neighbouring districts have ramped up banana and avocado production. Local farmers like Ms Mazvita Murapa and Miss Chiratidzo Mawoyo eagerly anticipate the plant’s completion, foreseeing improved returns and reduced logistical costs. Ms Murapa said there is a huge difference between current market prices of raw produce and market value of processed products. Ms Murapa said bananas are selling for US$0.10 per kg at the markets in Harare and Mutare, which is a far cry from what they will get once the processing plant is in full throttle. Miss Mawoyo said the processing plant will help reduce poverty among women and youths. She decried huge losses incurred when vehicles carrying their highly perishable products to the market are involved in road accidents or have breakdowns.   "

Senior Reporter A RECORD attendance, brisk business at the host centre, properly coordinated chronology of events, exhilarating soccer matches and musical gala as well as magnificent stage works remain some of the major take-aways from this year’s national Independence Day commemorations. Business at and around Murambinda, which was last year accorded town board status, was booming courtesy of the Uhuru commemorations. Commercial activities spurred by the hosting of commemorations have never been witnessed at Murambinda. From retailing, vending to tourism, the business was oversubscribed. Not even on such revered days like Christmas, Easter and Heroes’ holidays had such lucrative sales and bookings being recorded. True to the concept of demand and supply, a product like ice cream, for example, which normally costs a dollar for two in a normal situation, was going for US$2 during the commemorations at Murambinda. A former deputy head at Murambinda A Primary School, Mr Chifuruse Mushayabasa, who ventured into agribusiness and alcohol beverage retail business was an elated lot. Mr Mushayabasa, who is also into farming and runs an up-to-the-minute Musoni Night spot at the heart of Murambinda Town Centre retired from the education sector on medical grounds after being involving in an accident. “We have benefitted in a big way by hosting this year’s Independence Day commemorations. As businesses, we never witnessed the boom in sales like we witnessed this time around. In fact, we started making super profits during the preparatory stages of the event, almost a month ago. “People who have been coming and are still coming here have been procuring commodities, products and services from different providers at the town centre. “We recorded huge sales since last Saturday when delegates began to flock to this town. As you can see, there are winding queues of people wanting to purchase goods and we are ready to serve them as quickly as we can,” he said. Mr Mushayabasa said vendors also made a lot of money during the commemorations. Some vendors were selling food, airtime and data as well as mineral water, among others. Owing to hot weather conditions prevailing on the day, it was brisk business for juice and water stalls, ice cream and fruit vendors. Heavy rush was witnessed for shops selling fruit juices, beverage drinks and alcohol. “I have been operating at this growth point (now town centre) for decades, and I can confess that I have never witnessed or recorded such brisk business. I cannot complain, we have made good money. Our busiest days are usually during the Christmas holiday, but this was unprecedented. It has been something else,” he said. Small eateries and vendors selling fruit juices and water did brisk business, especially near the venue. Mr Joe Simboti was one of them. Mr Simboti, a vendor at Murambinda for years sells airtime, ice cream, edibles such as fresh chips and chicken, among others. “I wish if we could permanently host this national calendar event. Whoever came up with this idea that Independence Day commemorations should be decentralised must have had my business in mind. “I have made profits that I never made since I started vending in this area, some six years ago. We are thankful to President Mnangagwa and the organisers of this event for bringing big business to us here at Murambinda,” he said. Hotels, lodges and other informal traders at Murambinda also recorded huge sales as delegates attending the commemorations thronged these areas for accommodation and to purchase different wares. There was heightened activity for almost a fortnight prior to big day as delegates thronged different hotels and lodges to have a feel of the services. A chef who works at a local hotel, who spoke to this publication on condition of anonymity, said all hotel rooms were fully booked before the commemorations, resulting in some clients being turned away due to the overwhelming demand. At the end of it all, it was the province of Manicaland that was left with its tail wagging and walking with a spring in its step after hosting such a hugely successful national event. No wonder, the Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs, Advocate Misheck Mugadza, in a post event analysis interview, thanked all stakeholders who worked tirelessly for the successful hosting of the country’s 44th Independence Day commemorations. “We are very happy that our Independence Day celebrations went on very well. People came out in their numbers. The President gave us a very, very special message that will go a long way in guiding us as a province and as a nation. “The whole event from the start went on well without any disturbances. I am grateful to the local organising team, they worked very hard. “We thank Vice President Kembo Mohadi who chairs the Cabinet Committee for State Occasions and National Monuments. We are really thankful to his guidance and all relevant Government departments. Everyone participated whole heartedly,” he said.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/new-stanbic-bank-embarks-on-financial-fitness-workshop-for-smes/,NEW: Stanbic Bank embarks on financial fitness workshop for SMEs,"The ManicaPost   Business Reporter   LEADING financial services institution, Stanbic Bank, has established a financial fitness academy aimed at equipping Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with the requisite skills to handle their finances and grow their businesses. The financial fitness academy will be an annual event that will equip entrepreneurs with the relevant skills that will see them grow their business while compliant to the financial inclusion requirements in line with the National Financial Inclusion Strategy II, 2022- 2026 (NFIS II). Stanbic Bank’s Head of Enterprise Banking, Ms Auxilia Kambasha said the financial fitness academy will be in the form of training workshops countrywide through which customers will be equipped with financial modelling to assist them to draw up financial statements and tax compliance requirements, among other administrative and governance procedures. “The overarching goal of the bank is to partner our clients for growth. We are offering the training so that our clients develop and grow their business as they would have been equipped with financial basics that will assist them to make right decisions. The financial fitness academy will equip entrepreneurs with relevant skills that are critical and sustainable in achieving growth of their business while being compliant,” said Ms Kambasha. She said the first series of the training workshops recently kicked off in Gweru, Kwekwe and Chegutu. Ms Kambasha said investing in critical skills in the promotion of the SMEs will result in ripple effects in the growth of the economy which is the thrust of NFIS II. Financial inclusion is on the rise globally and continues to be a key enabler in wealth creation, poverty reduction, and improving the livelihoods of people in low-income groups. Ms Kambasha said Stanbic Bank is inspired by the quest to bring people and institutions together and maximise on their interconnectedness for mutual benefit. Stanbic Bank is aware that SMEs play a pivotal role in driving both developing and developed economies, contributing significantly to poverty reduction, employment creation, value addition, and economic resilience. “As Stanbic Bank, we believe that developing economies must prioritise financial literacy, access to financial products and supporting frameworks that ensure holistic growth and development,” said Ms Kambasha. To that end, the Standard Bank Group subsidiary is committed to equip SMEs with the key growth drivers on the back of the knowledge. Key factors that promote inclusion for SMEs include the cost of products and services; the complexity of financial products and services and the treatment received from service providers during the attempted access. “As Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe Enterprise Banking, we are eager to train our customers in financial modelling to assist them to draw up financial statements and tax compliance requirements, so that every business small or big moves together ushering in an era of development, poverty alleviation and resilience. “Our vision is “to achieve universal access and usage of a broad range of quality and affordable financial services that meet the needs of both individuals and enterprises.”,” she said. Ms Kambasha said Stanbic Bank wants to ensure that every segment of Zimbabwean society has access to basic financial services irrespective of social or economic status, gender, or level of education. She said access to, and usage of a broad range of quality and affordable financial products and services would open up opportunities for better livelihoods.   It provides a platform for low-income populations with the mechanisms to borrow, save and invest, and make payments.   Further, it enables them to plan ahead and better manage their finances. “Our financial fitness model provides a framework that will lead to the development of a stable, resilient, competitive, and inclusive financial sector that contributes to economic growth and broad-based wealth creation,” said Ms Kambasha, adding that Stanbic Bank understand that it has a role to play and is committed to actively work toward the attainment of enabling growth of SMEs.   "

Post Correspondent MANICALAND’S ideal climatic conditions have spurred the production of organic horticultural produce which has enabled the province to increase its exports and rake in about US$53.2 million into the country. Manicaland — a gateway to Mozambique — has good climatic conditions that make it ideal to produce diversified crops like macadamia nuts, tea, avocados, coffee, herbal tea, pineapples, cut flowers, bananas peas, carrots, cauliflower, sweet potatoes and stone fruits, organic ginger, turmeric and garlic, among others, with the ability to thrive in the export markets. Horticulture is one of the export low-hanging fruits for businesses and communities in Manicaland, and the sector has immense potential to gain a strong global competitive position, thereby providing substantial social and economic benefits to the province and the country at large. Further to this, the global markets for organic horticultural products remain attractive, and Manicaland has the potential to take over supply of the global horticulture market as production of fruits and vegetables drifts away from industrialised nations. The current boon in avocado exports comes at a time Manicaland has been steadily increasing its avocado exports from 2 746 tonnes in 2017 to 5 806 tonnes in 2021. The increase is due to improved production and new smallholder farmers planting more trees, making Zimbabwe the fifth largest exporter of avocados in Africa. Of late, there has been massive investments in the horticulture sector, which has resulted in improved productivity on the farms and estates, particularly through joint ventures. Buoyed by the new investments in the horticultural sector, the country is expected to lead the pack in the near future. Zimbabwe’s horticultural produce is on high demand in countries like the Netherlands, South Africa, China, United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates. Among the latest investments in the sector is a joint venture between Agriculture and Rural Development Authority (ARDA) and a private firm, Cicada, to grow avocados and macadamia nuts at its Katiyo Estate in Honde Valley. The partnership will result in increased horticultural exports from the province. ARDA board chairman, Mr Irvin Craig confirmed the development and said the joint venture, sitting on 505 hectares, has so far created employment for 325 people, tendering avocado plantations with about 300 tonnes of avocado produce already harvested and destined for the European market. “We have a contract farming agreement under the Public-Private Partnership Framework to establish at least a combined 500 hectares of avocado and macadamia nuts plantations with the produce targeted for export. “Under this agreement, we have planted Hass Avocados on 312 hectares and macadamia nuts on 193 hectares to have a total planted area of 505 hectares. Harvesting is still in progress, and to date 300 tonnes of avocados have been harvested. Our main market is mainly European countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Harvesting of commercial crop for macadamia is expected from the 2024/25 season. The current establishment has 325 employees,” he said. ZimTrade Manicaland Region manager, Mr Admire Jongwe said the province has vast opportunities to expand the horticultural sector and grow the country’s export revenue. Mr Jongwe also called upon established firms to incorporate smallholder farmers as out-growers. “Produce from the province, which have been driving national horticultural exports, include macadamia nuts, tea, avocados, coffee, herbal tea, pineapples, cut flowers, bananas and stone fruits. There is scope to grow the export of horticulture produce in Manicaland, leveraging on crops that can perform well in the province such as peas, carrots, cauliflower and sweet potatoes. “Sweet potatoes are mainly grown in Chipinge and Makoni districts where we are encouraging farmers to concentrate on viable varieties such as the yellow-fleshed ones. Further to this, there is scope to grow exports of sesame seed, widely grown in Chipinge, Nyanga, Makoni and Buhera districts. This crop has great potential for the province, considering its huge demand in the Mozambique market whose proximity to the province offers additional logistical and competitive advantages. “Flowers, which already have a lucrative market in countries such as the Netherlands offer export opportunities for growers in Nyanga, Vumba and Mutare. To grow the flowers output, there is need for established players in the sector to bring on board smaller players which will guarantee them access to markets,” he said. Mr Jongwe said Manicaland is also emerging as a key producer of chillies, peppers, wild fruits, essential oils and processed foods and heritage-based products. According to the Horticultural Development Council, the country is likely to export around 6 000 tonnes of avocados this year, and there is need to penetrate new markets such as China and India. “The 2024 season looks promising for Zimbabwean avocados. We are trying to export 6 000 tonnes, which will be the country’s biggest crop yet. Credit should be given to increased production from new producers from an estimated 1 500 hectares planted to date. “More investment is needed in infrastructure such as pack houses. We are working with stakeholders to push for new markets such as China, India and other South East Asian (countries) so that Zimbabwe remains competitive,” said the council in a statement on its X handle.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/vbus-to-change-the-face-of-buhera/,VBUs to change the face of Buhera,"The ManicaPost   Moffat Mungazi 
Post Reporter BUHERA has received a major shot in the arm following the implementation of key economic drivers that form the basis of its transformative development trajectory ahead of the 2024 national Independence Day Celebrations at Murambinda B High School grounds.   From rehabilitation of the road network to the construction of a modern standard pitch, new classroom blocks have been built, while others have received a facelift. Owing to the district’s severe aridity, boreholes have been sunk to augment the provision of water for domestic consumption and productive uses.   Significant strides have been made in equipping the water sources with the requisite solar powered accessories to make them fully functional. These are the long-term benefits the people of Buhera will continue enjoying after successfully hosting the independence commemorations. These projects are a vehicle for high impact and life-changing fruitful outcomes, fuelling the country’s drive towards Vision 2030 to attain an empowered and prosperous upper-middle income society. The end game of these initiatives and programmes being rolled out by the Second Republic is inclusive development — a state of progression and transformation that leaves no one and no place behind. Firm foundation Under the ongoing Presidential Rural Development Programme, previously marginalised areas are also prominently featuring in the national transformational growth matrix. Government’s Rural Development 8.0 initiative — whose other components include the Vision 2030 Accelerator Model, Pfumvudza/Intwasa, Presidential Poultry Scheme, the Presidential Goat Scheme, Presidential Fisheries Scheme, Presidential Blitz Tick Grease Scheme and the Presidential Cotton Inputs Scheme — is igniting unprecedented expansion in the countryside. Under this programme, Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) is set to drill 35 000 boreholes in the country’s eight rural provinces, translating to a borehole each for every village among the 35 000 by 2025. Cue the village business units (VBUs) In line with the Second Republic’s rural industrialisation agenda, the roll out of VBUs is already underway and already 50 VBUs have been established in Buhera alone, while another 50 are expected to be up and running ahead of the Uhuru celebrations. VBUs are broad-based viable enterprises envisaged to have multiple benefits to rural communities. They comprise of one-hectare drip irrigated nutrition and horticulture garden, water storage reservoirs, fish ponds, orchards and poultry projects. The areas largely targeted are in regions four and five — which are ordinarily dry areas. In Manicaland, VBUs have also been established in Chisuma, Temaruru, Tamburikayi, Hakwata, Chichesa, Mutema Secondary and at Chief Mutema’s homestead. A visit to Buhera last week revealed that work is already at advanced stages to operationalise the VBUs into vibrant enterprises. Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister, Dr Anxious Masuka last week toured some of the completed VBUs, including one at Dzenga in Village 14, Buhera West Constituency. Acting Chief Director for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Advisory Services, Mr Leonard Munamati said VBUs will be established alongside youth business units and school business units. He said these are robust measures being put in place to mitigate the adverse impact of the El Nino-induced drought that ravaged the 2023/24 summer cropping season and threatened food security in the province. Beyond that, the VBUs will ensure the provision of clean and safe water sources as well as food and nutrition and financial security to the rural population. The beneficiaries receive seed from Government to kick-start their agricultural ventures.
“The Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries and Rural Development is currently involved in the drilling of boreholes and establishing VBUs, youth business units and school business units. The target is to establish at least 10 000 VBUs by the end of this year and to achieve that, we are targeting to establish at least 1 000 VBUs, YBUs and SBUs every month,” said Mr Munamati. He said each VBU occupies one hectare and has a solar-powered borehole which will be fitted with tanks to facilitate drip irrigation. “These VBUs are normally about one hectare each and have a borehole that is drilled on site and that borehole will have solar-powered tanks installed so that there is drip irrigation. These are very important components because if we managed 10 000 of these it will mean 10 000 hectares of irrigated land,” he explained.    Work is already at advanced stages to operationalise the VBUs in Buhera into vibrant enterprises, with 50 already established while another 50 are expected to be up and running soon The VBUs will also carry out aquaculture and horticulture, he added. “The boreholes will, among other functions, provide drinking water for the communities, provide water for the establishment of nutritional gardens, orchards, fishery projects and water for dip-tanks,” he said. Mechanisation and optimisation The VBUs are receiving technical, extension and advisory support from Government through the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development to mechanise and optimise their operations to ensure sustainability. To maximise viability, collaborative and synchronised efforts between Government departments and agencies like Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA), Agriculture and Rural Development Authority (ARDA), Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), Agriculture and Rural Development Advisory Service (ARDAS — formerly Agritex) and Agriculture Marketing Authority (AMA), among others, will steer the VBUs. ARDA develops the business model for the VBUs and assists in their registration as formal entities run on sound commercial lines by locals. AMA contributes in the identification and linkages to markets for the VBUs’ products, which also determines the various crops they can viably grow. AFC provides the funding while ARDAS is responsible for extension and advisory services.
Previously marginalised rural communities are set to reap the fruits of the programme, with women and young people being the main targeted beneficiaries. Villagers in Buhera hailed the VBUs project, commending Government for initiating and implementing programmes that benefit rural communities. The villagers said farming can be a very lucrative venture when run as a business. “As villagers we are excited that we can now run a business of our own through farming. We are now utilising the land which had been lying idle, thanks to the availability of water sources that can facilitate drip irrigation. We will work hard to produce food for ourselves and also sell the produce to earn an income. By next month, we should be able to market some of our produce,” said Mrs Gracious Magumbo. A youth in the area, Mr Aleck Mabwe said with this latest development their lives will never be the same again. “Given that we live in a dryland water is an essential resource. These solar-powered boreholes are a real game-changer that will go a long way to transform our lives. With drip irrigation, we are geared for increased production and productivity,” he said. Water is one of the most important resources required in enhancing people’s livelihoods and is just what the doctor ordered for the nutrition gardens to grow a wide range of fruit trees in the villages. NDS 1-driven Vision 2030 Crucially, the projects being implemented by the Second Republic speak to the 14 key pillars of National Development Strategy (NDS1) — the country’s development blueprint to achieve the national aspiration of Vision 2030. Director for Agricultural Advisory and Rural Development Services (Manicaland), Mrs Phillipa Rwambiwa said VBUs are a game changer to transform rural communities. “The VBUs operated using solar-powered boreholes will open up avenues for the local communities to establish horticulture gardens, drip irrigation for high-value horticultural crops and nutrition gardens as well as fisheries, and piped water schemes. “This is one way of empowering rural women and young people to cater for their needs without depending on others. When run sustainably, the VBUs become commercially viable, which will enable the local communities to make profits and savings. Overall, this promotes new enterprise development, job creation and employment,” said Mrs Rwambiwa. She said poverty reduction is also hinged on the operations of VBUs, thereby increasing the quality of life for rural people through improved livelihoods and multiple streams of incomes. This, she added, should accelerate the attainment of Vision 2030 by ensuring food security, import substitution, poverty alleviation, access to safe and clean water and creating employment opportunities. Food and nutrition security President Mnangagwa’s administration is moving to promote resilience and sustainable farming through agriculture infrastructure development.   This is evidenced by the ongoing and continuous investment in agriculture research and technology development to enhance farming output. Accelerated agricultural production and productivity is a critical factor leading to the escalation of food self-sufficiency, which the Second Republic is working to increase from the current level to 100 percent. “Food and nutrition security is one of the 14 national priority areas in NDS1. ‘‘With these VBUs we can achieve that end while communal livelihoods also get greatly improved. They ameliorate hunger, starvation and poverty. This also accelerates value addition and beneficiation of agriculture production while also increasing productivity,” she said.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/minerals-leakage-elephant-in-the-room/,Minerals leakage: Elephant in the room,"The ManicaPost   Ray Bande
Senior Reporter OLD age think-tanks once wrote that looters don’t read, and readers don’t loot, but the unabated and alarming rate of mineral leakages, especially diamonds, lithium and gold, across the country and Manicaland in particular, is just too difficult to ignore. Ideally, mineral leakages are predominantly in the gold sub-sector and other precious and semi-precious stones like diamonds through smuggling and diversion to the informal market.   Experts estimate that the country could be losing billions of United States of America dollars annually through leakages. In the gold and lithium sub-sectors, of late, there have been reports of smuggling of minerals to countries such as South Africa, Dubai and China. Diamonds, for example, after being stolen from companies operating in the nearby Marange area, find a ready market in several buyers of foreign origin resident in some of Mutare’s leafy suburbs. A check by The Manica Post revealed that several foreign nationals, some with tertiary student status permits to justify their presence in the country, have set base in suburbs like Murambi, Morningside, Greenside and Fairbridge Park.   Gold buyers have also thronged Penhalonga area near Mutare where the mineral is sold in piecemeal to Fidelity Printers — the formal trend — but a considerable amount is reportedly being smuggled out of the country. In addition, it has also been reported that semi-precious stones discovered in some parts of the country like Hurungwe and Karoi in Mashonaland West Province where villagers extracted the stones without going through the normal processes that ensure Zimbabwe benefits as a nation, are allegedly smuggling the minerals. In an interview on the sidelines of the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development two-day workshop in Vumba last week, chairman of the Portfolio Committee, Honourable Joseph Msipa said they are seized with the matter of minerals leakage. “We are indeed concerned about the leakage of minerals as a committee. This is the reason why we will soon be calling for an indaba where we will bring together relevant stakeholders so that we map the way forward as a team. We are putting forward our suggestion as a committee to see the improvement of security on minerals in the country, and we hope we will achieve what we aspire to,” said the Shurugwi North parliamentarian. In a separate interview, speaking from a mining employees representative view, tough talking Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Union (ZFTU) secretary general, Cde Kennias Shamuyarira, said: “We have a well-orchestrated mafia extractive syndicate, right from some unscrupulous Government officials, colluding with the so-called investors at the expense of the working class and the majority citizenry. “Real economic development in a country can only be realised when we have radical policies on beneficiation and value addition to all our minerals and other natural resources.”   After extraction, gemstones such as amethyst, aquamarine, and garnet are illegally sold to unscrupulous dealers who smuggle and export the semi-precious and coloured stones in their raw form.   Cde Shamuyarira added: “I think we need to be very frank and candid to each other as a country and as a people. The whole issue starts from the investor, who comes into our space here in Zimbabwe, coming to invest in diamond, platinum or gold mining. “All the other countries that developed or are on the development path, they (investors) go there fully aware that they will put something and get something out of their initiative, and the people in the country they will be investing in, will also get something. “But our situation is so absurd. It is very skewed in the sense that you take a company like the now defunct Mbada Diamonds, they came with their machinery and expertise and all that we benefitted was employment of general hand workers. “Over and above that, there was no beneficiation. You cannot talk of beneficiation by a company of that magnitude when they built houses for displaced villagers. That was a prerequisite just like protective clothing for employees.”   Cde Shamuyarira said beneficiation should be noticed from the production of the end products, and not export of raw minerals as a way of also addressing rampant leakages of mineral. “The diamond was mined and is being mined, but there is no beneficiation. We should be having a polishing site where we employ people. After polishing diamonds, we must have the end product of rings, bracelets and so on. “That is what we call beneficiation, and once we have that we can curb leakages. “These diamonds are taken raw as they are to other people who know how to beneficiate our resources. This is why our theme for Workers Day this year touches on confronting extractive and parasitic investment. “These are the kinds of investments we are talking about whereby the country itself does not benefit and the employees do not benefit at all. You look at the salaries that people are being paid in these mines, it’s a pittance, save for the few middle management that serve the interest of the shareholders. “The rest are being paid amounts under the Poverty Datum Line and are wallowing in abject poverty, without any healthcare and education benefits. Overal, we do not see us as a country benefiting anything from these investments, simply because we do not have the end product being produced here,” he said. The gathering in Vumba was meant to establish a strong foundation for collaboration between MMCZ and the Parliamentary Committee, while equipping participants with a comprehensive understanding of the MMCZ’s mandate, strategic direction, and current operations. MMCZ was established to monitor and promote the export of all minerals produced in Zimbabwe with the exception of gold and silver which are dealt with by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.   Zimbabwe has 60 different mineral products, half of them currently being exported, but the country has been losing revenue from these minerals export owing to leakages at porous ports of exit such as Forbes Border Post in Mutare. While MMCZ has been monitoring movement of minerals from production site, with their inspectors operating within mineral producing sites, and partially through the export process, they have not been allowed to be stationed at the country’s ports of exit under the excuse that their presence would militate against ease of doing business. In their contribution during the MMCZ Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development workshop, a number of Members of Parliament emphasized the need to have MMCZ presence felt. Mutare North Member of the House of Assembly Cde Admire Mahachi said. “There is need to have MMCZ present at the place where minerals are getting outside the country. This is their actual job. Their job is not primarily in the offices, but in the field and the border is one place where they have to ensure that the country is not losing anything though their presence,” he said. Headlands Member of House of Assembly, Cde Farai Mapfumo said the country must not sacrifice the God-given minerals on the altar of ease of doing business. “Yes, we need to be seen to be facilitating the ease of doing business. No one denies that. However, we should not be seen to be sacrificing the God-given minerals on the altar of ease of doing business. “There are ways that can certainly be worked out to ensure that we secure our minerals, while at the same time provide ease of doing business for our visitors or investors.
“MMCZ should be right at the border and given space to operate without necessarily hindering the smooth flow of business at a given border post,” he said. Ideally, minerals are a finite resource that needs to be utilised for the benefit of the nation when extracted. Apart from being finite, the international prices of minerals fluctuate, further buttressing the need to utilise extracted minerals when they still have value. For example, the acute down spiraling of tantalite prices on the international market has resulted in the sudden disappearance of both local and foreign mining investors who had invaded Buhera District. Fielding questions from Members of the House of Assembly during the Vumba workshop, MMCZ’s corporate’s marketing manager, Mr Gumisai Nenzou said: “There is a fluctuation of the prices of minerals that we actively market as MMCZ. For example, there was once a hype around tantalite mining in Buhera District here in Manicaland. The demand was spurred by cellphone manufacturing clients who needed the product. “We saw numerous tantalite mining bases being set up in Buhera, and at the time tantalite was going for US$1 200 per kilogramme. Today, the same product has drastically gone down to US$100 for the same weight. “Given the production costs and other mining related expenses, it might no longer make any business sense, hence the disappearance of those who were mining it in Buhera,” said Mr Nenzou.   "
https://www.manicapost.co.zw/manicaland-embraces-new-zig-currency/,Manicaland embraces new ZiG currency,"The ManicaPost   Liberty Dube
Post Correspondent FOLLOWING the introduction of the gold-backed currency —Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) last Friday — businesses and members of the public in Manicaland have expressed confidence that it will hold fort against other currencies that will circulate alongside it. Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) last week unveiled ZiG as part of several policy measures to address exchange rate volatility, curtail inflation and restore macro-economic stability in the country. RBZ Governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu said ZiG will circulate alongside a basket of other currencies, and Zimbabweans have 21 days to convert their old cash into new money. He announced that the Zimbabwe dollar remains legal tender for all domestic transactions until April 30, when ZiG notes and coins will come into circulation. The 21-day transitional period will see the Central Bank conducting an extensive educational and awareness campaign on the new currency’s structure and security features before the notes and coins are released at the end of this. The Central Bank also asserted that ZiG’s value will be secured by both the quantity and worth of precious metals, along with the foreign currency reserves it maintains. Those interviewed by The Manica Post yesterday expressed optimism that the new currency will hold its own against other currencies circulating on the market. The new currency has kicked illegal money changers in Mutare, Rusape and Chipinge below the belt as most of them have vanished from their customary trading locations in the Central Business District (CBD).   Only small groups of money changers lingered near their customary spots that were bustling hubs before ZiG’s debut. Mr Lovejoy Saunyama, a kombi operator who plies the City — Dangamvura route in Mutare could not wait for the circulation of the new money. He said he is having a torrid time with passengers over the issue of change. “We are still accepting the RTGs until April 30 because we realised that the commuters should be allowed to use the currency they have in their wallets or pockets, be it RTGS or US$. “To us the introduction of ZiG is welcome and was long overdue. “We cannot wait for its circulation, come April 30. We are eager to see its real impact when it eventually hits the streets. Most kombi routes are US$0.50 cents, and it is imperative for Government to quickly address this issue,” he said. Mr Tendai Marange, who sells construction material like burglar bars, door and window frames at Murahwa People’s Green Market, said ZiG is welcome, considering that most bond notes, especially of smaller denominations were no longer useful as traders were rejecting them due to their eroded value. “It had become a nightmare to transact in RTGS cash, especially when you need to buy foreign currency. “For now, we are trusting the process, although we are yet to get hold of ZiG. We believe it will serve its intended purpose. “My bank is yet to allow us to transact in the new currency, but I am sure that the development will provide a win-win situation between clients and businesses,” he said. A money changer who requested anonymity said: “I can’t lie; business has been low my brother. We are all in a state of confusion, and do not know what to do. “We are yet to figure out how we will be operating when ZiG notes hit the streets. Our clients are equally confused, especially concerning the issue of conversion rates. For now, we are currently dealing with United States dollars and South African rands.” Mr Munyaradzi Zinomwe, a social commentator and businessman, said he is excited about the development. “It is a very positive move to the transacting industry. “With the spiralling black market rate on ZWL, a bold move was urgently needed. We wait for April 30 when ZiG notes will be hitting the market. We are confident and hopeful that this move will be beneficial to all of us,” he said. A bar operator from Chikanga said Government, through the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has a critical task to educate people on how ZiG will operate. “It is very important for them to let us understand more about the new currency so as to build confidence. They should launch a media blitz like roadshows, newspapers, radio and TV adverts and reach out to everyone educating them about the new currency,” he said.   "

Post Correspondent OVER 50 million kilogrammes of tobacco have gone under the hammer since the opening of the marketing season last month, with growers pocketing over US$176m, a 12 percent increase in earnings compared to the same period last season. Statistics released by the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) on Day 20 shows that the average price for contracted tobacco was US$3.52, while at the traditional auction floor the price was US$3.65. Contracted tobacco has contributed 47 094 959 million kilogrammes, while self-financed was at a distant 3 084 398m kgs. About 94 percent of tobacco is grown under contract farming, and farmers are paid 75 percent in foreign currency and 25 percent in local currency. Tobacco unions have been rooting for 100 percent retention, arguing that their foreign currency earnings were being drained while paying production costs charged in USD. Due to the skewed arrangement, tobacco farmers are largely victims rather than beneficiaries of the contract system as contractors inflate USD prices of inputs, under-supply them with inputs required per hectare and make unilateral deductions on earnings of farmers, thereby leaving many in debt. A total of 689 809 bales have been delivered to the floors, with contract bales amounting to 638 720 and those at auction floors amounting to 51 089. A combined 20 088 bales were rejected. The highest price for auction floors tobacco stood at US$5.05, while the contract auction has hit a ceiling of US$6.99, up from last season’s high of US$5.60. The lowest quality leaf attracted US$0.10 per kg, which remains the same from last season. The firming of the prices during this marketing season has been attributed to high quality and depressed volumes of the leaf due to the El Nino-induced dry spell. Tobacco Farmers Union Trust president, Mr Victor Mariranyika said the auctioning is progressing on well without major hindrance. He said this year’s prices were fairly higher than those of last season, which will allow growers to break-even. “So far the auctioning is going on very well at all floors, save for one company that is struggling to pay growers on time. Cash is readily available at the banks and farmers are accessing their money without hassles. Unlike last season where the prices were low, this season’s prices have improved, and we hope this will continue until the end of the season. “Last season most auction floors had US$4 as their ceiling price, but this season the prices have shot above US$5.99 depending on the quality. The average price this year is US$3.50 compared to US$2.50 that obtained last season,” said Mr Mariranyika. He also implored TIMB to strictly implement stringent statutory measures introduced by Government for both growers and merchants to safeguard the integrity of the contract system so that farmers are not short-changed while guaranteeing contractors’ returns on their investment. He said tobacco merchants failing to pay farmers on time as per requirements must be blacklisted, deregistered and barred from contract farmers without first paying them, lest it becomes a free-for-all situation. “However we call upon TIMB to investigate some deductions being effected on the growers’ earnings. Some of the deductions are not part of the contract between growers and the merchants. TIMB must not abandon growers at the critical juncture, but take these concern serious and make sure they do not persist. “Tobacco growers are bitter that instead of protecting them, TIMB is sitting on the fence leaving them at the mercy of greedy merchants. “Growers need every cent they are entitled to earn a return on their investments, and it is a cumulative of these dubious deductions that pushes them out of business. Farming is a business, and it is the profit that keeps tobacco growers going,” said Mr Mariranyika.   "

Senior Reporter WHILE the El Nino phenomenon inflicted a prolonged dry spell that adversely affected the production of food, leading to the declaration of a state of disaster in the country, the same weather condition has seen a boon in the timber industry which is reportedly accruing profits. Zimbabwe’s commercial timber industries are largely concentrated in the Eastern Highlands of Manicaland, given its favourable climatic and environmental conditions for the fast growing exotic species. In an interview on the performance of the sector against a background of the El Nino-induced drought, Timber Producers Federation of Zimbabwe (TPFZ) chief executive officer, Mr Darlington Duwa said normal seasons are usually problematic by making timber harvesting operations deleterious as the roads will be slippery, while plantations will be inaccessible. “The effects of the dry spell had mixed effects on the timber industry. In a normal season (with abundant rains), timber harvesting operations are deleteriously affected as roads will be slippery and timber compartments become inaccessible, particularly those on steep slopes and heavy soils. “This necessitates expensive road rehabilitation as well as increase in the cost of production. In this context, the El Nino phenomenon has helped timber producers,” he said. Mr Duwa said timber drying has also been made easier with the dry spell. “Air drying of produced timber is quicker in dry weather. The industry does not have adequate artificial (kiln-drying) capacity, hence their reliance on natural (air drying). As a result, the El Nino phenomenon has assisted in timber drying,” he said. However, the dry spell also had its fair share of negative impact to the industry. “Despite the positive impacts outlined above, there are negative impacts, chief among them being the negative effect on the growth of trees — this has slowed the growth rates, with tree mortality in the most extreme of cases. “Tree planting is also affected as this has led to reduced tree planting. Already our planting targets for 2023/2024 have been negatively affected. There is also the aspect of increased production costs as employees need to be nutritionally assisted,” he said. “Overly, the association is happy with the rate at which members are planting. Members of the public, perhaps would like to see higher rates of planting. However, it is not planting alone which is important. The maintenance of the plantations (silviculture) is important if one is to realise quality products at the end of the rotation. “The current and projected short term economic situation may not allow timber companies to plant and maintain large areas of plantations. “However, it would be good if the rate of planting could be maintained at current rates without negative fluctuations,” he added. Mr Duwa outlined some factors that hinder large-scale plantations. “Several factors hinder large-scale planting. The most important are the financial resources for land preparation, planting, weeding, pruning and thinning. They work against large-scale planting. “Financial resources to maintain the trees — weeding, pruning and thinning, labour to carry out the operations and equipment for operations, are some of the factors that have a bearing on the size of a plantation,” he said. Mr Duwa said weather conditions also have an effect on planting patterns. “Weather conditions — planting is done when adequate rains have been received, to achieve acceptable seedling survival rates and tree growth. Sound forest management requires that forests are planted in such a way that one has evenly distributed age classes not just one huge age class. “One can use an analogy of tomatoes. If you plant a large area of tomatoes, they usually ripe at once and you have to harvest them. If one is to lose the planted area due to say fire or pests, this will be terrible loss,” he said. Mr Duwa said the prices of timber products are fair, but bemoaned ‘dumping of products to third parties’. “We are happy as an industry with the prices obtaining on the market, but there seems to be dumping of products mainly by third parties who sell wet timber. Customers are advised to use dry timber for structural works,” he said.   "
