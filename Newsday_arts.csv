                     Inaugural Vinyl Festival prepares to launch
                    ","ARTS promoter and curator Eleni Athikati has announced that she will be hosting the first ever Vinyl Festival in Zimbabwe at Ella the Garden in Newlands, Harare from Tuesday May 21 to 26. Athikati, who was born in Zimbabwe and raised in South Africa and Greece, told NewsDay Life & Style that the vinyl record was almost becoming extinct, yet it is the most trustworthy memory bank of Zimbabwean folk and musical history. A vinyl record or a phonograph record (also known as a gramophone record, especially in British English) is described as an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. Most Zimbabwean music was recorded and stored on a vinyl record and would be played on a radiogram. Fused sungura band Bantu Spaceship whose music was recently recorded on vinyl will headline the Vinyl Festival which has lined up several local, regional and international vinyl DJs. “I have been organising arts events in the garden including Katikitiki Space since 2010 when I came back to Zimbabwe from Greece and identified lots of gaps in the arts industry of which some can be collectively solved. “Artistes have in most cases lamented the misrepresentations by middlemen and artistes can now market and speak for themselves from the Garden and Katikitiki Space,” Athikati told NewsDay Life & Style. “The Vinyl Festival in Zimbabwe will take place at the Ella Garden in Newlands in Harare from Tuesday May 21 to 26. Katikitiki Space will be our main stage and it will mainly be Vinyl DJs, including a performance from the Bantu Spaceship band.” There are many reasons advanced as to why the vinyl record was phased out or became scarce on the market. Athikati believes that the coming of the compact disc, which was more conveniently played on a cheaper play back device was one reason among many others, which include but are not limited to shelving of antiquated vinyl disc cutting machines and the arrival of digitised forms like MP3, mini disc and solely digital discographies. The vinyl can further be described as an analog audio recording pressed in vinyl. The 45 revolutions per minute (RPM) record holds one song per side, while 33 1/3 RPM and long play (LP) record holds an entire album. Athikati clarified that on May 21 there will be a Vinyl Fest launch which will mainly be characterised by meeting and greeting. All evenings will be musical events which feature local and international vinyl DJs, while in the afternoons experts and academics in the music industry will conduct workshops. “Wednesday May 22 afternoon from 12-4pm, there will be a turntable workshop on vinyl and new music hosted by @nyauist (CPT) and Fabian Freedom Youth (CPT) and in the evening 17:00-20:00 hours listening session plus discussion with @bikoemcee; Professor Joosty on Vinyls and Sound System Culture (UK/JHB). “Thursday May 23, 12:00-16:00 there will be Turning Tables 2 DJ Lab workshop hosted by DJ Lua and Farakataza on Women and Vinyl History and in the evening 18:00-20:00 Scratch: Documentary screening and discussion by Tomas Brickhill and Shade of a Woman,” She highlighted. The Gramma Records which housed Zimbabwe Music Corporation and the Record and Tape Promotions was the major supplier of vinyl records in Zimbabwe. Afro-fusion band Mokoomba has also in the recent past made recordings sold on vinyl in Europe, Athikati said. She also mentioned that the Katikitiki Space has a public address system and band kit which has been specifically reserved for small bands which can manage their performances at very low volumes.   "

                     Young jazz artiste on the rise
                    ","BUDDING jazz musician Tawananyasha Chirombedze, whose stage name is “Sparko Gucci — Lion of Zaka”, says artistic growth and creativity have revolutionalised his music which had mainly revolved around natural disasters such as drought and pandemics like COVID-19. He has since grown in his music to reflect on his personal life and surroundings. The 19-year-old musician, who has relocated from Zaka, Masvingo province to Budiriro, in Harare, told Newsday Life & Style that his musical journey dates back to 2018, but his song writing skills were not good enough back then because he could only get ideas for songs from events affecting humanity on a larger scale. “I used to sing about natural disasters and pandemics. I have realised my music has evolved which has allowed me to be creative while reflecting on my life and surroundings. Growing up listening to music of the late Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi and Prince Musarurwa became my musical influences,” Chirombedze said. The budding musician said he was privileged to have a father who had a background and passion in the arts industry, specifically entertainment. “Having my father’s backup, who has a background in the entertainment industry, worked in my favour. He once worked for the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation around 2011, while managing musicians and organising shows for the likes of Charles Charamba and Blessing Shumba. This helped me to get the support of my father.” he added. The musician is set to launch his debut seven-track album titled Godo Ramuinaro at Harare Sports Club on June 15. The album consists of Godo Ramuinaro, the title track, Mwana Haasi Wangu, Zvichaita Riini, Chiedza, Jenaguru, Mudiwa Ever and Makorokoto. The musician said the album portrayed how people easily overlook others’ good deeds once they make mistakes.     "

                    ","PROGRAMMES manager for the China Zimbabwe Exchange Centre (CZEC), Donald Rushambwa has implored visual artists from all walks of life in Zimbabwe to take part in a painting competition titled African Charity Fundraiser Competition whose deadline is May 13. In a wide-ranging interview with NewsDay Life & Style Rushambwa said the selected artworks would be showcased in Shanghai, China, from May 25 to 30. “Painters should submit a canvas portrait of 80cm by 60cm on a selected theme of their choice from their portfolios that either address clean water and sanitation, wildlife protection, education, love for life and nature or Sino-Zim relationships. “The winning and approved selected artists shall sign a licensing agreement for their work with CZEC,” Rushambwa explained. The competition is a fundraiser whose proceeds shall be channelled towards charity organisations in Zimbabwe which spearhead community development projects. “We observed that there are limited means of sourcing funds; as such we came up with a competition or facility whereby artists from the communities can seed their paintings towards community development and CZEC will exhibit them at the forthcoming African Charity Fundraiser Competition in Shanghai, China this May 25 to 30. “The artists stand a chance of partaking in future invitations to China for their own exhibitions or cultural exchange programmes. Once the paintings are sold, an honest transaction will be channelled towards the home town or city or the artist’s place of choice for developing issues and concerns like borehole drilling, schools and road construction, housing development, scholarships, stationery supplies, wild life preservation, tree planting and community gardens. “Our extensive marketing has in the past yielded business leads for the artists. As testimonies to this we have the likes of the late Antony Bumbira, Batsirai Muskwe and Hope Mafeko. The artists except for Bumhira have since chosen projects of their choice in their communities. The names of the artists who seed their artworks shall be inscribed on the walls of all the developmental projects which are funded through the proceeds from their artworks,” he clarified. Rushambwa also revealed that their organisation is prioritising continued education and responsible citizenship for the artists and the youths. “We need to increase the market share for the Zimbabwean creative work, while observing and being wary of patents and copyright protection. Our organisation is highly involved in youth activities that enable citizens who love their communities. Likewise artists shall receive further training in their various capacities,” he added. Meanwhile, CZEC will be represented at the forthcoming China-Africa Expo in Kenya by its sister organisation Dream Building Supporting Association.   "

                    ","SOUND engineer Mbaki Nleya believes that the country’s broadcasting sector can do better through exposure to multi-media technology which is necessary for the advancement of quality and service delivery. Nleya, who started the country’s first multimedia exhibition in 2017 with very few attendees, told NewsDay Life & Style that the number of people attending has increased over the years, attracting exhibitors from countries such as Germany and the United Arab Emirates. “I got inspiration to start multi-media exhibitions because the country needs to broadcast even better. I noticed that there are a lot of opportunities in the country, for example there was no college that trained professional audio in the country and I found an academy called Audio Academy and there were no exhibitions for multimedia then I started one,” he said. Nleya mentioned that it is not advisable to enter an oversubscribed sector, but one should start something new and make a difference to help to develop the country. The sound engineer will hold the third edition of the multi-media exhibition on June 26 and 27 dubbed Audio & Visual Expo under the theme Innovate to Elevate: Enhancing Creativity and Entrepreneurship at Nelson Mandela Hall, Harare Showgrounds. The expo will accommodate exhibitors from various industries including sound PA systems technology, broadcasting (radio and television), cameras, drone technology, lighting technology and multi-media technology, among others. Nleya said feedback from the previous editions of the event was encouraging. The expo provides a platform to grow the local showbiz scene and also helps many industry stakeholders to find and discover business opportunities through exposure, workshops and interactions with exhibitors. The event is open to anyone who works or has interest in the entertainment technology industry. However, children under the age of 16 will not be allowed to enter unless accompanied and supervised by a responsible adult for educational purposes. "

                     MaBlerh back to host The Real Housewives of Durban reunion
                    ","SHOWMAX, an African streaming service, has announced that MaBlerh will host The Real Housewives of Durban reunion for the second year in a row. MaBlerh has become the first African to host multiple reunions of The Real Housewives franchise, including The Real Housewives of Gqeberha S1 and The Real Housewives of Johannesburg S3. The Season 4 finale of The Real Housewives of Durban dropped on April 24 and to no one’s surprise, it broke the internet and became the number-one trending topic in South Africa. After an eventful and dramatic season, the ladies had their final dinner on their trip to Namibia, where they confronted each other about things that had been happening in their circle. The confrontations resulted in the ladies splitting into two core groups. On the one side were Sorisha Naidoo, Slee Ndlovu and newcomers Ameigh Thompson and Angel Ndlela. On the other side, Jojo Robinson, Maria Valaskatzis, Nonku Williams and newcomer Zama Ngcobo, with the ladies from each camp not seeing eye-to-eye, viewers have a lot of unanswered questions. The drama is far from over, as Showmax will be airing the reunion in two parts on May 15 and May 22. “I know how heavily invested the audience is in The Real Housewives of Durban, which is why I can never go in there and be flippant,” MaBlerh said. “There are people who wake up at midnight to watch the show, so I know that I must take it seriously and deliver on all fronts. I am honoured to be breaking the record for an African host and I’m excited to be back for the second time: it’s going to be a more comfortable experience for the ladies because we now have a rapport.” MaBlerh has promised viewers that he is not going to leave any stone unturned. “When I approached the reunion last year, it was different. Things were very heated, and the ladies were barely speaking to one another, so I had to be very sensitive and aware of everything that had happened. “With Season 4, it is going to be different because it is not the same season, but I am still going to get to the bottom of things, and I will hold the ladies accountable for the things they have said and done.” MaBlerh said he was there to represent the audience, who have made the show successful. “I am there to represent the viewers. I have been watching the tweets, I have been watching the concerns and comments and, trust me, all of those things will be addressed. I do not operate in a vacuum,” he said. “I watch, and after every episode, I am on social media looking at what the sentiment is. If you have tweeted under the hashtag #RHODurban, your concerns will be covered.” The Let it Rain Films’ executive producer Sam Kelly said they had chosen MaBlerh because he was a big fan of The Real Housewives franchise and had a very deep connection with the Durban franchise. “MaBlerh is a fantastic host and he did a spectacular job last season; he managed to tackle the themes with the grace and sensitivity they needed,” Kelly said. “On why people need to watch the reunion, Kelly said: “It has been a crazy season and the reunion will be your chance to understand all sides of the story. You will see things from everyone’s perspective.” The first season of The Real Housewives of Durban set a then-record on Showmax for the most first-day views and went on to be released in 28 territories outside Africa on Hayu, Peacock and Bravo, the original home of The Real Housewives franchise. Seasons 2 and 3 were among the 10 most-streamed titles on Showmax in their launch years and are currently streaming on Hayu. Meanwhile, the second season of The Real Housewives of Nairobi is set to premiere on Showmax on May 10 with new episodes every Friday. The Real Housewives of Nairobi follows the lives of the most stylish, opulent and hardworking women in Kenya as they navigate their relationships and careers. The season 2 features returning cast members Dr Catherine Masitsa, Minne Kariuki and Vera Sidika, who will be joined by newcomers Farah Esmail, Reja Keji Ladu and Zena Nyambu. "

                     Hearing-impaired having it rough in healthcare
                    ","THE Deaf Arts National Culture Entertainment (Dance) has raised concern over the challenges its members are facing in accessing healthcare in Zimbabwe. The organisation identified some of the challenges as shortages of interpreters whenever they visit healthcare centres. Dance projects manager Tsungirirai Tsikira said rigorous efforts must be made to deal with the challenges facing the hearing impaired community. She was speaking as Dance prepares for its third show in Bulawayo and fifth in Zimbabwe with the stage production expected to amplify an awareness message and advocacy for the challenges the hearing impaired community faces at healthcare facilities. “Our project is called The Silent Stage because what we say from the stage you will not be hearing anything and the only thing that you will hear will be voices of the interpreters seated in the audience,” Tsikira said. “The programme that we are running is called Celebrating deaf culture: A journey of theatrical inclusion and empowerment. It is about empowering the deaf community through theatre and it is a first in Zimbabwe to have a deaf drama group.” The production will be spreading the message through a performance so that others can understand the challenges the deaf community faces. “Through powerful storytelling and compelling performances, the production sheds light on the profound impact of interpreter shortages on accessibility and understanding in healthcare. “This is made possible through the help of sign language interpreters who will be voicing everything that will be said on stage. “With each performance, the team behind The Missing Bridge demonstrates an unwavering commitment to fostering empathy and understanding for deaf individuals’ experiences.” Tsikira said recent engagements at prestigious events such as the Shangano Arts Festival in Hwange and the heartfelt reception in Beitbridge had reinforced the importance of the ongoing dialogue. Tsikira said they were thrilled to see the impact The Missing Bridge had during the tour of Zimbabwe. “Our journey has been one of growth and impact, and we are grateful for the opportunity to continue sharing these important stories with audiences across the country,” she said. Dance will be taking its production to the Midlands province as it spreads the message across the country. “Looking ahead, The Missing Bridge has set its sights on Gweru for its next stop towards the end of May. With the support of Culture Fund CreativeActions2 and the EU delegation to Zimbabwe, the production remains committed to its mission of provoking thought and inspiring action towards a more inclusive society,” she added.

The song titled Where I'm Going has won many hearts on digital platforms as she creatively added a classic spark to her music. In a social media post prior to the release of the project, the musician expressed heartfelt appreciation to the late icon for his inspiration and guidance. “To my friend and mentor, the late Bob Nyabinde, thank you for your guidance and inspiration.” Griffiths said. Nyabinde, who was popularly known as the Headmaster, rose to prominence with his Chabuda Hapana track from the album Panenyaya which earned him a Zimbabwe Music Award gong in 2003 in the Best Afro-jazz Artiste category. He passed away in December last year at the age of 68 after a long battle with diabetes. Griffiths rose to fame with her duet with dancehall president Winky D titled MuGarden which garnered the fastest YouTube views shortly after release and made it to number one on the BBC Afrobeats charts. Apart from working with Winky D, Griffiths has worked with several other musicians such as Baba Harare, Bling 4 and Ammara Brown and has since released songs on her own which include Maita Basa Baba, Ndichatarisa and Titungamirei, among others.

Writing on his social media handles, the musician said: “Whenever we mention drug abuse, we think of men mostly, but forgetting that there are also women who are victims of substance abuse. Some of these women are driven into taking drugs due to abuse, be it in marriages or relationships. Love should not hurt.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) indicated in a report published this year that globally about one in three women (30%) of women worldwide had been subjected to either physical or emotional violence by sexual partners or non-partners in their lifetime. “Most of this violence is intimate partner violence. Worldwide, almost one third (27%) of women aged 15-49 years who have been in relationships report that they have been subjected to some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner,” the report established. The report further noted that violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health and may increase the risk of acquiring HIV in some settings. The report also indicated that these forms of violence lead to depression, post-traumatic stress disorders, sleep difficulties, eating disorders and suicide attempts while an analysis carried out by the organisation also revealed that women who experienced intimate partner violence are almost twice likely to experience depression and problem drinking. “Sexual violence, particularly during childhood can lead to increased smoking, substance use and risky sexual behaviours. It is also associated with perpetration of violence (for males) and being a victim of violence (for females),” WHO noted. "

The annual Bulawayo Shutdown gig is held at Queens Sports Club on the closing day of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF). Social media reports claimed the field had been destroyed by thousands of fans who thronged the stadium, making it almost impossible for cricket to be played at the ground. Club vice president Sindiso Mazibisa, however, sought to allay the fears in a statement. “The mandate and scope of the Clubs operation like most Clubs is that we are a social club and hosting concerts and music shows or family events is within our lessor/lessee and partnership with Zimbabwe Cricket which lessees the grounds, which for the record are not exclusively for hosting Cricket matches,"" Mazibisa said. ""The notarial lease agreement is a public document registered with the Registrar of Deeds in Bulawayo and the contents and addendums are self-explanatory."" He explained that pre and post show meetings were held to deal with the issues of repairs where a security deposit to cover all the damages at the facility was paid. “The grounds are being rehabilitated, as has been the case over the years when shows are held,"" he said. ""The Bulawayo Shutdown is not the first and will not be last show to be hosted at the Queens Sports Club and such articles are not good for the Arts and Business sectors as the Club is central and has the kind of environment needed for such shows."" One of the organisers of the gig, Jordan Dube, said they witnessed the biggest turnout in years.  “I am not able to reveal the exact number of people who attended the show but all I can say is that event was the most successful event to be held by Harris Lodges and Harris Entertainment in terms of numbers,” he said. He claimed that the Bulawayo Shutdown solidified its place as one of the most attended musical shows in the city’s history.

                    ","MULTICHOICE Zimbabwe general manager Siyabulela Jemsana says the illegal copying and sharing of content, including movies and television shows from torrent sites, is threatening millions of livelihoods and undermining the future of the creative industry worldwide. Jemsana made the remarks ahead of tomorrow’s anti-piracy workshop to be held under the theme: A Culture of Learning: Building Zimbabwean Creative Sector Brick by Brick at a local hotel in Harare. The workshop, meant to raise awareness of and curb piracy, is an effort of MultiChoice Zimbabwe in partnership with the local arts mother body, National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ). In the face of spiralling piracy of films, television shows, music, software, literary works and other creative content, African economies, Zimbabwe not excluded, are losing millions of dollars in revenue. “Current estimates put the global cost of content piracy at US$71 billion each year and this amount grows each year as content pirates get more sophisticated in their illegal copying and sharing efforts, and consumers continue to turn to pirated content for their entertainment fix. “This massive loss of income is more than the gross domestic product of whole geographical regions! Zimbabwe is not spared from this, and our creative sectors are suffering,” Jemsana noted. “Local actors, actresses, producers, directors, sound engineers, cameramen and all the people employed in our creative industries lose out when pirates steal content. Beyond the film and television sector, piracy affects software, music, literature and other fields. This prevents Zimbabwean creatives from being able to tell our own stories and has a devastating knock-on effect on the Zimbabwe economy.” Jemsana said MultiChoice Zimbabwe had been at the forefront of the battle against content piracy hence being a member of Partners Against Piracy, a pan-African campaign established specifically to fight piracy, support content-producing industries and protect creatives from job losses because of piracy. He said joining hands with the arts council was meant to ensure greater impact of anti-piracy efforts in Zimbabwe. “As a leader in local and international video entertainment, MultiChoice Zimbabwe has long addressed the issue of pirated content with Zimbabwean audiences through its television channels and on its digital platforms, raising awareness of this crime and how consumers can avoid falling prey to it,” he said. The anti-piracy workshop takes place on the backdrop of the World Intellectual Property Day commemorated on April 26, and within Culture Month, celebrated annually in May. This year’s edition of Culture Month is being commemorated under the theme Our culture: Building Zimbabwe Brick by Brick reflects the national drive to implement the national development strategy. Jemsana said the workshop would raise awareness on intellectual property and piracy within the arts and culture sector targeting both up-and-coming and mainstream artists and key stakeholders in the cultural and creative industries. The workshop will also highlight the importance of public-private co-operation in the fight against piracy and safeguarding copyright. “Piracy poses a legitimate industry threat, and immediate action must be taken to stop pirates and protect the rights of content creators and providers. This action must come from the united efforts of government institutions, entertainment businesses and all professionals working in the creative industries,” Jemsana noted. “This first workshop being jointly hosted by NACZ and MultiChoice Zimbabwe, is supported by Zimbabwe Music Rights Association and the Zimbabwe International Film Festival Trust. It promises to go a long way in educating the public about the seriousness of this problem and better protecting our artists.” NACZ acting director Barbara Gotore said Zimbabwe was home to a rich and dynamic creative sector with huge potential for growth, but piracy was undermining this potential and actualised growth. “The prevalence of piracy can be attributed to a number of contributory factors, including the scarcity and high cost of genuine products, poverty, poor distribution networks, a slow judicial system, and new digital technologies that easily enable the illegal, mass reproduction of copyright protected works,” she said.

                     Exploring Bling 4's music themes
                    ","RAPPER Bling 4, born Farai Gadzani, has potential to become a big figure in the local hip-hop scene due to his deep lyrics, modest demeanour and impactful music. His music zeroes in on the plight of Zimbabwean youths. Mature themes are explored in the artiste's songs. Bling 4 is basking in glory with his most recent release Ama2k, which explored a number of contentious topics related to those born from 2000. The musician has demonstrated consistency in the music industry, which has seen him performing at prestigious events alongside big names in the industry. In contrast to other artistes who pull public stunts or throw tantrums in anticipation of releasing new music, Bling 4 has not yet been caught up in social media drama or controversy to prop his music. NewsDay Weekender Life & Style examined a few of the topics the musician has addressed in his songs over the years. Confronting Ama2k The artiste took his voice and lyrical prowess to confront the generation. The musician broke his silence by imploring the public to urge youths born from the year 2000 to get their lives in order, saying that he had been watching them for a while. The rapper painted the generation as hopelessly unprepared for the future, fixated on pricey brands of cars, mobile phones and clothes. He portrayed this generation as obsessed with social media, having grown up in the digital age surrounded by smartphones, social media and instant connectivity. He said the generation is only concerned about having the internet to browse what bloggers have posted on social media. The musician further depicted the generation as actively participating in hate speech and cyber bullying on social media. Refusing to give in to peer pressure The artiste’s music relates to the pressure people are put under, especifically by social media. Bling 4 explored the theme of living an authentic life, showing a resolute, hardworking man who is content with his life while persistently striving for improvement, refusing to give in to peer pressure and living under the false pretense of belonging to groups he does not belong to. The song also serves as a reminder to young people that success does not come easily. Making mistakes Along with highlighting mental health issues as people turn to alcohol as an escape from reality, the artiste also explored emotional struggles that resonated with many listeners who have gone through similar struggles. To stay on the right path during these trying times, the artiste prays to God to lead and guide him through song. Predicament of the country’s youths Many young people in the nation can identify with the artiste's exploration of the predicament of a young person without support systems, who cannot afford to miss out on opportunities or make mistakes in life while their counterparts from wealthy families appear to have everything on a silver platter.

                     Model urges men to seek help when vulnerable
                    ","THE World Health Organisation defines mental health as a state of well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realise their abilities, learn and work well and contribute to their community. In Zimbabwe, several initiatives have been carried out in advocating for mental health with artistes coming through with awareness messages. Model Aaron Kahari urged men to seek help when they are vulnerable, be involved in various initiatives as a way of coping with stressful situations and find ways to express themselves fully, adding that they should never be victims of mental health. NewsDay Life & Style caught up with Kahari to talk about developments in the modelling industry, mental challenges faced by men, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, male models breaking barriers and diversity in the industry, among other things. Background I am Aaron Kahari. I was groomed at Top Model Zimbabwe under Karin Coric in 2021. I had the opportunity to work with a lot of brands like Edgars, Jet and Victaks Wear to mention a few. I also took part in a number of fashion shows. I then ventured into pageantry last year participating in the Mr Zimbabwe International which was my first competition where I emerged third runner up. I also worked with popular musicians like Freeman where I featured on his song called Man to Man as a video vixen. I love socialising and working out in the gym. Developments in the industry The modelling industry has become versatile with flexibility on age, weight, height or body types. There are no restrictions anymore although one is required to maintain healthy habits. Male models have broken barriers of fashion and modelling by participating in shows and photoshoots where they are flexible enough to wear feminine clothing and makeup. This has helped in breaking various gender norms and stereotypes surrounding masculinity. It has been difficult for some conservative and traditional people to accept the breaking of barriers by men who venture into modelling while others are embracing the change being brought forth by the fashion world. Such is to be expected as people have different views on life. Diversity Diversity and representation in the modelling industry helps people to feel included because it reflects reality. It allows people to connect with a wider audience, which promotes inclusivity and empowers people with confidence. Contribution of social media Social media advertising being pushed by the fashion world has fostered inclusivity. There has been inclusion of different body types, ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. This has impacted a lot of people positively because there is fair representation of people which restores self-esteem, confidence and body positivity. Ways of coping with mental health problems Men face various mental health challenges including societal pressure to maintain traditional masculine norms, misconceptions that sharing feelings and emotional breakdowns, just to mention a few, are signs of being weak. This gives rise to feelings of isolation, depression and anxiety. My ways of coping with stress include seeking support from friends and going to the gym but there are other ways of coping with stress like seeing a professional, meditation, removing yourself from stressful conditions and people and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I recommend men going through mental health issues to express themselves through writing in a journal, partake in poetry sessions, art or music and also participate in community events. Exploring various coping mechanisms helps to keep a healthy emotional life. It is important for men to recognise the value of seeking help when needed. "

                     Mlalazi acknowledges fans request for Manyowa collabo
                    ","IN response to requests from his fans, multi-award-winning gospel singer Everton Mlalazi has released Fill Our Hearts, a captivating worship song featuring celebrated songstress, Janet Manyowa. The song, which was released on Wednesday, has an accompanying video that was produced by FilminZim in partnership with Reliable Hub of Innovation Media House under the supervision of Mlalazi’s wife-cum-manager Gamuchirai. The song is a showcase of powerful vocals and rich lyrical prowess by Mlalazi and Manyowa while the visuals and cinematography depict great artistry. The video also features actor Farai Chigudu and comedian Dereck Nziyakwi. “Towards the end of March, we made a poll as to which female Zimbabwean gospel artiste fans thought I should collaborate with and Janet was the favourite among many. I approached her, she agreed and the whole of April we worked on the song writing, recording and video filming until the release on May 1,” Mlalazi told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday. “The song was produced by Nigel Nyangombe and for the production of the song’s video, we approached FilminZim which gave us Malaika Mushandu (former Miss Zimbabwe) as the video director and Joe Njagu (veteran filmmaker) as the cinematographer to come up with a video. The production team roped in all the fantastic actors to be part of the cast.” Speaking on the inspiration behind composing the song, Mlalazi, who frontlines the Worship Therapy band, said: “We need the presence of the Lord right now more than ever. We need Him to fill our hearts and minds and change us to better people.” “It is the message of our time when what we need the most is hope and trust in the Lord, that when we open our hearts, He is ready to fill us. Psalms 81:10 says I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.” The Ndokutewera Muponesi hitmaker reckons it has been an amazing experience working with fellow multi-award winner Manyowa. “Janet does not just have musical ability, but depth in her knowledge of the scriptures. Everything was flawless and we were all excited to be working on this song together,” Mlalazi said. A member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, Mlalazi said the key to a fulfilled heart lies in embracing the spiritual teachings of Christianity. “According to scripture, Ephesians 5:18, our ultimate purpose is to find joy in God’s presence and live to His glory, but this can only be achieved through the Holy Spirit,” he noted. “What an honour to have collaborated with my brother Everton Mlalazi for this beautiful track. Our prayer is that He may fill our hearts,” Manyowa said. Commenting on the video on YouTube, @craigtsepontuliki00 said: “Behold the celestial union of two celestial voices, a sacred duet that transports the listener to the ethereal realm where the soul is lulled by the heavenly choruses of Everton Mlalazi and Janet Manyowa. Gaze upon the pristine beauty of this visual ode, a divine dance of sound and sight, captured in a paradise-like setting that mirrors the eternal glory of the Almighty.”  “Fill our Hearts is enveloped in a symphonic masterpiece, their angelic harmonies weave a tapestry of hope and inspiration, resounding with the powerful message that a fulfilled heart is found in the embrace of divine teachings.” The video had garnered 29 000 views on YouTube by yesterday.

Major events to mark this day’s celebrations include a walkathon, which was inspired and founded by Guti to encourage fitness and healthy living as well as a  music concert to be held at ZAOGA Braeside the same day. In a statement, chairperson of the Ezekiel Handinawangu Guti day Elder Tawanda Sarireni said: “People will be walking in groups and the target distances are two-and-half, five and 10 kilometres. People will also do aerobics with a renowned fitness trainer.” The event will be graced by local and international gospel artistes including United Kingdom-based Free to Worship group already in the country for the event. Local artistes set to perform include gospel diva Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave, Sebastian Magacha, Pastor Haisa, Pastor David Mabvuramiti and Sir Benjamin Rupapa. Sarireni noted that Archbishop Guti’s achievements undoubtedly changed people’s lives as evidenced by the establishment of churches in every community in the country and in over 169 nations, schools, hospitals and a university (Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University) in the country and abroad. He said such achievements were worth celebrating as they would inspire generations. Sarireni added that they had partnered private organisations, the business community and government ministries such as the ICT ministry. Officials from the ministry descended on Chitungwiza on Tuesday to train the youth on how to use computers with much emphasis on cyber security.

                     Flying Bantu aims to attain regional appeal
                    ","TINASHE Maoneni, the leader and vocalist of the Afro-fusion band Flying Bantu, has confidence the ensemble will attain its goal of being the most sought-after entertainers. The band has Amkela Moyo (guitar), Bongani Moyo (bass), Joshua Alufasi (keys) and Sam Gulubane (drums). Maoneni describes himself as a dreamer and creative with a deep desire and love for food, art, people, nature and old cars who transfers this understanding of creative work into music and dance. “Flying Bantu is a band from Victoria Falls. Born of the Zambezi and its magical pool of people and cultures. Our music enculturates various genres from rock, reggae, funk, jazz giving an alternative and unique African expression,”Maoneni told NewsDay Life & Style. He said the band’s forthcoming album was purposefully hewed to harness the African region and global appeal and increase the number of followers to their shows. Flying Bantu’s second 10-track album is titled FejaFeja, street lingo for an unconventional form of illicit gambling characterised by conjuring and optical illusion. New approach to the arts which encompasses music, film and performances I am not sure we can call it new more than it is different. The whole idea is to just remain as true to ourselves as possible and not fall too much into the industry norms and dictates. Otherwise we all end up sounding and looking the same. We believe everyone has a unique voice and that there are many different palates out there for different expressions. If we stick to it, explore and carve out our own sound and texture, then maybe someone will relate. Activities lined up in support of music after the Sauti zaBusara Festival After Sauti we already had a tour of South Africa and have a couple of festivals lined up in Zimbabwe and Botswana. But our main thrust this year is to finalise the release of our album FejaFeja.  FejaFeja has tracks like Dzora Moyo, Mwana Wenyu, Chizukuru, FejaFeja, These days, Lala, Watching Angels, Forever Together and No Money No Honey. The album has a broad theme and reflects on the hardships that people endured as a result of the COVID-19-induced difficulties which prompted a new undesirable normalcy of a hand-to-mouth living that has been adopted by many people. The album seeks to restore the spirit of hard work through developing honest transactional ways of doing profitable business. Achievements The biggest one is remaining steadfast and pushing our dream. It is tough out here Tendai. In a country without much of a music industry to speak of; we have toured internationally, we have performed at major festivals and music events alongside esteemed and powerful African musicians. We have put out an album and now are releasing a second one which we are really proud of. Comment on the African music scene I do not know where to start but it holds massive potential. What the Nigerians and South Africans are doing with Afro-beats and amapiano is just the tip of the iceberg. It is paving way and giving confidence to the African musician while opening the eyes and ears of the world to the immense talent we have here. We just need to believe more in ourselves and our right to be seen and heard. African music is a force to reckon with and can lead from the front. Closing remarks   Thank you to everyone who has supported our dream. Without an ear to land on there can be no music. Please be on the lookout for our upcoming album this year so when you get a chance; hop on to our social media platforms and stay connected. "

""We are going to be doing more of these shows including, not only that but also workshops to try and foster knowledge about what jazz is because there's a lot of misconception about the genre. “People think that when you play smooth, slow music or when a song is just slow it is jazz (but) there is a whole concept to jazz, so we also need to start educating the young ones and the public about what it is."" Meanwhile, Dereck Mpofu made a surprise appearance before Willis Wataffi Afirika who was invited on stage by Prudence towards the end of the show. Wataffi took the crowd down memory lane with Afrika Revenge's yesteryear hit song ""Wanga"". Also in attendance was Jazz patron and renowned eye specialist Solomon Guramatunhu –who was the guest of honour, Katrin Simon (German embassy head of culture) and prominent lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa. ""It was an amazing experience and a super honour to be up on stage with artists whom I idolised before I began my musical journey as well as fellow artists I am now proud to call my friends. I felt special and encouraged amid my elders. We all amazingly complemented each other so well and I feel it's the beginning of a swell jazz musical journey,"" Nicholar said. Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Katomeni said having a platform to perform is always welcome and appreciated by a lot of local jazz artists. ""Having such a unique event being put together was special…I truly enjoyed the whole event, it was absolutely memorable and of course, I cannot leave out the audience that came through to listen to some fantastic jazz music and celebrate in one accord the beauty of jazz music,"" said Katomeni. International Jazz Day is recognised in over 190 countries worldwide. In Harare the crowd's enthusiasm was palpable, and the artists fed off the energy, pushing the boundaries of their creativity. Rute Mbangwa performed Shiri an original composition as well as the song ‘Autumn Leaves’ which is a jazz standard track. ""The jazz show was an unforgettable experience,"" said Mbangwa after her display in which she perfomed Shiri, an original composition as well as the song ‘Autumn Leaves’ –a jazz standard track. ""Collaborating with fellow musicians allowed us to create a mesmerising fusion of sounds that left the audience enthralled. It was a true celebration of the power of jazz in bringing people together to create something beautiful in the moment. The concert not only showcased unity of purpose among the artists but also Meck's organisational capacity in putting together a seamless experience for jazz lovers and highlighting the genre's vibrant community. Established by the General Conference of UNESCO in 2011 and recognised by the United Nations General Assembly, International Jazz Day brings together countries and communities worldwide.

                     Gurira amplifies voices of vulnerable women
                    ","AWARD-WINNING actress, playwright and UN women goodwill ambassador Danai Gurira says she wants to shine a light on Africans to fight impunity and amplify voices of those who are never seen or heard. Gurira made the remarks recently during the United Nations Security Council Open Debate on preventing conflict-related sexual violence where she urged the council and member States to acknowledge women and survivors all over the world. “Shockingly, sexual violence in conflict zones against women and children is being committed all over the world. This issue has become vast and widespread, from Colombia to Ukraine, Israel, occupied Palestinian territories, Haiti and closer to home for me as a Zimbabwean, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Central Republic of Africa and Sudan, this issue has become prevalent for more countries, not fewer,” she said. Gurira urged the UN Security Council and member States to acknowledge women, survivors and to specifically shine a light on people of Africa in particular, to fight impunity. “Nothing is more dangerous than crimes that are not acknowledged, unseen and allowed to persist. My hope is to amplify voices of those who are never seen or heard, to acknowledge their suffering, make sure they are not forgotten and to hold those who allow this to continue responsible.” Gurira said. The actress said she was exposed to issues of sexual violence when she, as a playwright, sought to create a narrative that would amplify the voices of women and girls caught in the crosshairs of war, where she was seeking their unheard voices and it became her broadway play Eclipsed. With the help of a friend at the United Nations who at the time worked in the Children and Armed Conflict department, she visited Liberia and spent time with women who had experienced atrocity wishing to be heard and participate in the change process and to heal from all that had been taken from them. Gurira is best known for starring in films such as the Black Panther as General Okoye, her role in the series The Walking Dead, Continuum, Eclipsed and Familiar, among others. She is also the founder of Love Our Girls, an awareness-building campaign focusing on the plight of women and girls around the globe and the co-founder of Almasi Arts, which gives access and opportunity to the African drama artists.

                     Nyanga: A tale of courage, conservation amid adversity
                    ","VETERAN filmmaker Eddie Ndhlovu has described his forthcoming film titled Nyanga as a tale of courage and conservation amid adversity. Shot at Lake Kyle in Nyanga and in Harare over a span of 15 days, the film showcases the stunning beauty of Zimbabwe’s natural landscapes while highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. Set against the breathtaking backdrop of Nyanga National Park, the film, directed by the dynamic duo of Ndhlovu and Jakov Dakovic, promises to captivate audiences with its powerful narrative and stunning cinematography. Produced by Talent Chitauro and written by Ndhlovu, Nyanga is a work of love that celebrates the rich cultural heritage and natural beauty of Zimbabwe. The film follows the journey of Panganayi, a dedicated ranger whose life is intertwined with the majestic rhinos he tirelessly protects. Portrayed by the talented Collin Ncube, Panganayi’s unwavering commitment to conservation is put to the test when he faces the ruthless threat of poachers infiltrating the park. When news of the poachers’ arrival reaches him, Panganayi confronts his greatest challenge yet. Armed with nothing, but determination and the support of his dedicated team, he embarks on a perilous mission to protect the rhinos at all costs. The film delves deep into Panganayi’s personal struggles, from the loss of his beloved wife to the challenges of raising their children amid the turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through it all, Panganayi finds solace in his family and draws strength from their unwavering support. Ndhlovu said Nyanga was more than just a film, but a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the power of resilience in the face of adversity. He said the choice of Nyanga National Park as the backdrop for the film had several motivations and storytelling advantages. “The first impression we got from Nyanga when we did our location scouting was the natural beauty of Nyanga National Park. Its stunning landscapes and scenery provided a visually appealing and immersive environment for the audience. The natural beauty enhanced the storytelling by creating a sense of wonder, emphasising the importance of conservation and also bringing out the aspect of the setting of the film which is a remote park,” Ndhlovu said. “Nyanga National Park has a cultural heritage and historical significance that was woven into the storytelling. It also has historical landmarks that brought to life the cinematic picture that we were looking for. He added: “Also, we wanted to film in a real national park as the setting brought an air of authenticity to the film. It allowed us to capture the unique characteristics and atmosphere of Nyanga National Park, making the audience feel like they are truly involved in the story.” Despite facing numerous challenges during production, including unpredictable weather conditions and logistical complexities, Ndhlovu said the dedicated team behind the production of the film remained steadfast in its commitment to bringing the important story to life. “With meticulous planning and unwavering determination, we overcame every obstacle to deliver a cinematic masterpiece that is sure to leave a lasting impact on audiences,” Ndhlovu said. “As the film prepares for its much-anticipated release, audiences can look forward to being transported on a soul-stirring journey that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the importance preserving our planet’s precious wildlife.” The cast of the film that uses Shona with English subtitles includes Andre Ndhlovu and Brandon Mushaninga as the DOPS starring Collin Ncube, Benhildah Kandawasvika, Hardlife Makuku, Llyod Mazengula, Talent Nyamayedenga and Peter Chester.

Ntandoyami Tanatsiwa Chikore digital and communications officer at Kumbekumbe Trust said the Street Café was a platform which intended to uplift the youth through performance and visual arts disciplines like dance, music, theatre, drawing and painting. Chikore said Kumbekumbe Street Café would be a regular activity that would bring the youth together through the arts to share their common values about education and career while they have fun. “This Street Café has helped us to bring together people through a creative process which involves usage of the arts,” Chikore said. Junior mayor Denzel Whata an Advanced Level student at Seke 1 High School who was in the company of junior councillors said: “We see this as an opportunity for young people to showcase their talents. Chitungwiza has lots of untapped talent and occasions like this help in identifying hidden creatives. We really appreciate youth peer to peer drive on empowerment through presenting locally and globally. This is a good move in pursuit of Vision 2030.” Lovemore Chiwawa marketing and communications officer for the Society of Musical and Cultural Arts, an organisation that promotes artists and empowers them to be entrepreneurs, said the arts were the most rewarding form of entrepreneurship. “We nurture their talents and engage them while they prepare for their careers. We also want to remove members of society from being vulnerable to what can be avoided and cured like engaging in early marriages, substance abuse and absence of knowledge on career guidance and correct training,” Chiwawa said.

Masa ran from April 16 to 18 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Anibal told NewsDay Life & Style that she highly rates Masa which became her second international tour this year after a well-received performance at the Sauti zaBusara in February.  The Masa is a cultural platform for promoting African performing arts. And some of their objectives are to support creativity and good quality productions including facilitating the movement of artistes and their works within Africa and throughout the world. Anibal will pre-launch her music album Maria Wenyu on May 3 at the Ella the Garden in Harare. The event will include a Press conference and time to share her memories with fans after her performance at the Masa. “My Maria Wenyu pre album launch shall give the audience quality time through songs Maria Wenyu, Gogoride, Bhonzo Muderere and Sarungano ahead of the official album and music video launch on June 8 at a venue yet to be decided. My forthcoming music album is a collective effort of many music producers such as Keith Farquharson, Trust Semende, Chiweda and Rodney, among others. “I had two performances, the first one was at the Pelais De La Culture — Salle Francois Lougah and on April 18 which was our Independence Day in Zimbabwe I performed at Yelams where I met Dobet Gnahore (Côte d'Ivoire), Nelida Kaar (Cameroon), Zulu Alves (Cape Verde), Maasai Vocals (Kenya) and Freddy Masamba (DRC). My greatest experience was with Dobet Gnahore who had her fond memories of watching the late Chioniso Maraire rekindled through my mbira playing. Mbira legend Chioniso Maraire was arguably one of the youthful mbira players to emerge from Zimbabwe who became internationally celebrated and left a void which is yet to be filled. “African culture is very diverse and African music has so many beautiful characteristics which are interlinked and therefore becoming easier and easier for us to connect to each other in a jam session,” Anibal said. She teaches mbira music instruments at the Music Crossroads Academy. Anibal believes that everyday is a learning day and wishes to claim global appeal in teaching and training after her studies at the Midlands State University. The Bhonzo Muderere hitmaker shared the beauty of her voice with Jah Prayzah and hopes she remains inspirational to many school-going children who are doing visual and performance  arts as a subject where music holds a huge stake. “The new curriculum has visual and performance arts as a subject and shall help in levelling the ground and ascertaining the relevance of infrastructural development. The cost of establishing musical arts education centres is high and requires a collective approach which involves the government and the corporate world. “Competitions such as the Allied Arts, Chibuku Neshamwari, Jikinya Dance Festivals have helped in putting into prominence music and dance cultures of Zimbabwe and ironically there is still an annoying level of lack of supporting infrastructure including well manufactured music instruments,” she said.

Nhanhanga, famed for the award-winning jazz instrumental Matida Hostel and now a teacher at the Zimbabwe Music Crossroads Academy, will be out to offer more than a performance at the event. Carol Makoni, provincial arts administrator National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ), Manicaland, said the festival would coincide with the International Jazz Day which is a United Nations observance celebrated annually on April 30. The day is meant to create awareness on the importance of jazz music. The festival is the brainchild of NACZ. “The Manicaland Jazz Festival intends to breathe life into the jazz genre which is not very prominent in Manicaland. The bands set to perform include WaCharie,  Steve Chikotie, Expression Band, Brian Nhanhanga and Too Open Band. Renowned drummer, Sam Mataure, will also perform at the festival,” Makoni said. “Academic and music education guru Tendekayi Kuture, who is a retired music lecturer from Africa University, will present a paper on the history of jazz music and its evolution to the different forms which are being played nowadays.” Jazz music was well received by music educators for classroom teaching as the musicians behind it quickly adopted an emphasis to usage of exciting elements of music including proficiency in performance and improvisations. In a similar manner it appears it is the only type of music after classical and choral music to occupy a significant part of school curriculum. Accordingly, several schools in response to Industry 5.0 and Continuous Assessment Learning Activities now have jazz bands. Prince Edward, Allan Wilson, Churchill Boys and Watershed College bands pursue both popular music and jazz narratives.  Zimbabwe College of Music in conjunction with Africa University run a Bachelor’s Degree in Jazz which has several alumni who have impacted the arts industry significantly. The International Jazz Day is an international day declared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in 2011 to promote jazz music as a soft tool for uniting civilisations across the globe and it is celebrated annually on April 30. Over the years the American embassy in Zimbabwe through its Public Affairs Section has brought in several jazz artistes and bands to entertain at the Harare international Festival of Arts. Through such a development it is quite notable that each and every continent or country just to be on point now has its own type of jazz music. Tanga weKwaSando is a well-known township jazz musician whereas the likes of Dudu Manhenga, Prudence Katomeni, Philbert Marova, Victor Kunonga, Brian Nhanhanga are popular for what is called Afro-jazz.
